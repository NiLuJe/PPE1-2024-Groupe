   Although it is not required, many parents and godparents choose to dress

   During the medieval and Reformation eras, infant baptism was seen as a way
   to incorporate newborn babies into the secular community as well as

       such as these." This seems to confirm that infants can have a personal
       relationship with Jesus just as parents can have a personal
       relationship with their babies. More importantly, Jesus confirms that
       babies of believers belong to the kingdom of God. In other words,
       babies of believers are counted as believers, not unbelievers.
       Therefore, Jesus specifically instructs not to hinder them.^[86]
