   Buckle up, parents! Your baby’s first year is a whirlwind of milestones.
   You’ve already seen them take their first breath, heard their first wail,
   and changed their first dirty diaper. (Only a couple thousand more to go,
--

   So get your cameras ready — here are the milestones you can expect during
   your baby’s magical first year of life!

First month

   It may seem that your baby is simply an eating, pooping, and sleeping
   machine at this point. But a lot is going on in that tiny body. Milestones
   to watch for include:
--
Second month

   Your baby is starting to act, well, more baby-like. By the end of 2
   months, your baby is likely to be:

     * gurgling/cooing
--
Third month

   Your baby is progressing from dependent newborn to more independent baby
   (yay — you might find those 5 minutes to take a shower!). This is when
   some of that cuteness overload starts to kick in. Watch for:
--
Fourth month

   At this stage, your baby is taking the milestones already achieved and
   perfecting them. For example, they may hold their head up more
   consistently and for longer periods, grasp toys with more coordination,
--
Fifth month

   Your baby continues to grow, explore, and master. As their strength and
   coordination increase, you may notice that your baby is:

     * rolling from tummy to back and then back to tummy
--
Sixth month

   Your baby’s growing up! They may now be:

     * sitting up briefly without any support
--
   Given that they are now getting better and better at grasping and holding
   objects, the American Academy of Pediatrics says 6 months is a good time
   to begin to encourage your baby to use spoons and their hands to feed
   themselves. (We’re warning you: It won’t be pretty.) You can even
   introduce a sippy cup or regular cup with help.
--
Seventh month

   Your baby continues to build on what they’ve already learned. Milestones
   include:

--
   You might notice that your little one can now roll over, sit up, and move
   objects from hand to hand or hand to mouth like a pro. You might also
   begin to see your baby:

     * rocking back and forth on their hands and knees or scoot along the
       floor (precursors to crawling)
     * pulling up to a standing position
     * drooling — a lot (some babies will be cutting their first teeth around
       this age)
     * continuing to babble (was that a random ma-ma or da-da you just
       heard?!)
     * developing stranger or separation anxiety — this is a kind of distress
       babies feel when they’re separated from their parents or primary
       caregivers

--
Ninth month

   Your baby is on the move! They may be:

     * crawling
--
Tenth month

   Your baby conintues to explore and experiment. Watch your baby as they’re:

     * moving from pulling to stand or crawling to “cruising,” or walking
--
Eleventh month

   In addition to reaching, crawling, and cruising, your baby may be:

     * continuing to explore language, giving you more mamas, dadas, and
--

   Congratulations! You officially have a toddler, and you’re no worse for
   wear — except for maybe that time your baby gave your hoop earring that
   really bad tug and… well, we digress.

   During their twelfth month, your baby will likely be:

     * cruising, standing briefly unsupported, and maybe even taking a step
--
When to talk with your pediatrician

   While most babies will reach milestones at roughly (and roughly is the
   operative word here) the same age, there’s a wide range of “normal.”

   Your sister’s baby walked at 10 months and yours is still crawling at 13
   months? Normal. Your 9-month-old baby can pick up Cheerios like a vacuum
   but your neighbor’s baby the same age continues to struggle? Yep, that’s
   normal too.

   Babies born prematurely or with a health issue or congenital disorder can
   also take more time to reach milestones. And one 2018 study found that
   girls tend to reach milestones before boys (although the differences
   weren’t huge).

   All along the way, your baby’s pediatrician will be looking out for
   milestones and watching your baby’s progress. If your baby’s doctor feels
   there’s a need for intervention (screening, testing, or therapies, for
   example), they’ll let you know. And don’t shrug off your own intuition. If
   you feel something needs investigation, speak up.

   Keep your well baby appointments (typically 5 to 6 in the first year) and
   see them as an opportunity to chat with your pediatrician about what’s
   going on.

   Remember that the average ages for reaching certain milestones are just
   that — averages. Some babies will do things earlier, while others will do
   them later — and that’s all usually OK.
