       Hello !! I am wondering if anyone else is experiencing the lack of
       uploads on the development of the kids. Since my baby turned 1 the app
       is not giving me the weekly updates. Is there something wrong?

       I can't stand when everything you read about 37 weeks, screams that
       the baby isn't yet. Nothing is developed! ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®. Come. On. I have six
       kids and #7 on the way. All born between 36-38 weeks. Baby come, when
       baby comes. Stop stressing moms out stupid websites!
