   [Intro]
   You remind me of the babe (What babe?)
   The babe with the power (What power?)
   The power of voodoo (Who do?)
   You do (Do what?)
   Remind me of the babe

   [Verse 1]
   I saw my baby
   Crying hard as babe could cry
   What could I do?
   My baby's love had gone
   And left my baby blue
   Nobody knew

--
   Or puppy dog tails?
   (Thunder or lightning?)
   Then baby said

   [Chorus]
   (Dance, magic dance) Dance, magic dance
   (Dance, magic dance) Dance, magic dance
   Put that baby's spell on me
   (Jump, magic jump) Jump, magic jump
   (Jump, magic jump) Jump, magic jump
   Put that magic jump on me
   Slap that baby, make him free!
