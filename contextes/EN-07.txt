   The rescuers believe they reached the vessel soon after the baby was born
   on the day Spain celebrated the Epiphany, a Christian holiday where
   children traditionally receive gifts.

   The captain of the rescue boat said they knew there was a pregnant woman
   on board, but were surprised to find "a totally naked baby who was born
   10,15 or 20 minutes earlier".

   Domingo Trujillo said when they reached the vessel, the mother was lying
   on the floor of the packed raft while the baby was being held by another
   passenger.
