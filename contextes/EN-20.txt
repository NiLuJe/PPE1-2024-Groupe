   Babe is a 1995 comedy-drama film directed by Chris Noonan, produced by
   George Miller and written by both. It is an adaptation of Dick
   King-Smith's 1983 novel The Sheep-Pig, which tells the story of a farm pig

   animatronic puppets.

   Babe was filmed in Robertson, New South Wales, in 1994 and released
   theatrically in the United States and Canada on 4 August 1995, going on to
   become a critical and commercial success with several Academy Award

   After being used in a "guess the weight" contest at a county fair,
   orphaned pig Babe is brought home to the farm of the contest winner,
   Arthur Hoggett. There he is taken in by Border Collie Fly, her irascible
   mate Rex and their puppies and befriends a duck named Ferdinand, who wakes
--
   useful and be spared from being eaten.

   Dismayed when the Hoggetts buy an alarm clock, Ferdinand persuades Babe to
   help him get rid of it. In doing so, they wake Duchess, the Hoggetts' cat,
   and wreck the house in the ensuing chaos. Rex sternly instructs Babe to
   stay away from Ferdinand and the house. Seeing Fly saddened when her
   puppies are put up for sale, Babe lets her adopt him. With the Hoggett's
   relatives visiting for Christmas, Hoggett decides against choosing Babe
   for Christmas dinner, and tells his wife Esme that Babe may bring a prize
   for ham at the next county fair. Ferdinand's love interest Rosanna is
   served instead, prompting Ferdinand to escape the farm. Babe investigates
   the fields, where he witnesses a pair of sheep rustlers stealing Hoggett's
   sheep and quickly alerts Fly and the farmer, preventing the rustlers from
   taking the whole flock.

   Impressed after seeing Babe sort hens, separating the brown from the white
   ones, Hoggett takes him to try and herd the sheep. Encouraged by an
   elderly ewe named Maa, Babe gets the sheep to cooperate by asking nicely,
   but Rex perceives Babe's actions as an insult to sheepdogs. When Fly
   stands up for Babe, Rex attacks and injures her and bites Hoggett's hand
   when he tries to intervene. Rex is subsequently chained to the dog house
   and sedated, leaving the sheep herding job to Babe. One morning, Babe
   scares off a trio of feral dogs attacking the sheep, but Maa is mortally
   injured and dies as a result. Hoggett, thinking Babe was responsible,
   prepares to shoot him, but Fly finds out the truth from the other sheep
   and distracts Hoggett long enough for Esme to inform him about the dogs'
   attacks on neighboring farms.

   When Esme leaves on a trip, Hoggett signs Babe up for a local sheep
   herding competition. As it is raining the night before, Hoggett lets him
   and Fly into the house, where he is scratched by Duchess, who in turn is
   temporarily confined outside as punishment. When she is let back in later,
   she gets revenge on Babe by revealing that humans consume pigs. After
   learning from Fly that this is true, Babe runs away and Rex finds him the
   next morning in a cemetery. Hoggett brings a demoralized Babe home, where
   he refuses to eat. Hoggett feeds him from a baby bottle, sings "If I Had
   Words" and dances a jig for him, restoring Babe's faith in Hoggett's
   affection.

   At the competition, Babe meets the sheep that he will be herding, but they
   ignore his attempts to speak to them. As Hoggett is criticized by the
   bemused judges and ridiculed by the public for using a pig instead of a
   dog, Rex runs back to the farm to ask the sheep what to do. After
   promising he will treat them better from now on, the sheep disclose to him
   a secret password. He returns in time to convey the password to Babe, and
   the sheep now follow his instructions flawlessly. Amid the crowd's
   acclamation, Babe is unanimously given a perfect score. When Babe sits
   down next to the farmer, Hoggett praises him with the standard command to
   sheep dogs that their job is done, "That'll do, Pig. That'll do."

   Babe is an adaptation of Dick King-Smith's 1983 novel The Sheep-Pig, also
   known as Babe: The Gallant Pig in the US, which tells the story of a pig
   raised as livestock who wants to do the work of a sheepdog. The main
   animal characters are played by a combination of real and animatronic pigs
--
   from the adults.

   After seven years of development,^[6] Babe was filmed in Robertson, New
   South Wales, Australia.^[7] The talking-animal visual effects were done by
   Rhythm & Hues Studios (R&H), Animal Logic and Jim Henson's Creature Shop.

   producer George Miller and director Chris Noonan.^[8] Noonan later
   complained, "I don't want to make a lifelong enemy of George Miller but I
   thought that he tried to take credit for Babe, tried to exclude me from
   any credit, and it made me very insecure... It was like your guru has told
   you that you are no good and that is really disconcerting."^[9]

   his name off the credits on internet sites, which is just absolutely
   untrue. You know, I'm sorry but I really have a lot more to do with my
   life than worry about that... when it comes to Babe, the vision was handed
   to Chris on a plate."^[10]

   In 1998, a sequel directed by Miller, Babe: Pig in the City, was released,
   but it failed to achieve the same success as the first film.^[12] In 2006,
   a video game based on the original film was published by Mastertronic

   The musical score for Babe was composed by Nigel Westlake and performed by
   the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Classical orchestral music by
   19th-century French composers is used throughout the film, but is

   Babe was a box office success, grossing A$36.7 million (US$29 million) at
   the box office in Australia;^[15] US$64 million in the United States and
   Canada; US$34 million in the United Kingdom and over US$254 million

   Art Direction and Best Film Editing, winning Best Visual Effects.^[18] At
   the APRA Music Awards of 1996 it won Best Film Score for Westlake's
   work.^[19] In 2006, the American Film Institute named Babe #80 on its list
   of America's Most Inspiring Movies.^[20] On review aggregator website
   Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 70
   reviews, with a rating average of 8.26/10. The website's critical
   consensus reads: "The rare family-friendly feature with a heart as big as
   its special effects budget, Babe offers timeless entertainment for viewers
   of all ages."^[21] Metacritic gave the film a score of 83 based on 16
   reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".^[22]

   Because of its subject being a piglet, Babe was initially banned from
   Malaysia in order to avoid upsetting or annoying Muslims (who view pigs as
   haram). The ruling was overturned almost a year later, and the film was
   released direct-to-video.^[23]

   When Babe was released in the US, it is reported that "activists around
   the country staked out movie theaters with flyers documenting the
   real-life abuses of pigs".^[24] The film had a marked effect on the growth
