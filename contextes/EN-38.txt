Immunizations to protect infants from severe RSV

   CDC recommends you use one of these two tools to protect your baby from
   getting very sick with RSV:

     * An RSV vaccine given to the mother during pregnancy
     * An RSV immunization given to infants and some older babies

   Most infants will not need both.
