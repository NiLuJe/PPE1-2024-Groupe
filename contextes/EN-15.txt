   Tips and Activities: What You Can Do for Your 9 month old
   Baby standing and playing with toy

   As your baby’s first teacher, you can help his or her learning and brain
   development. Try these simple tips and activities in a safe way. Talk with
   your baby’s doctor and teachers if you have questions or for more ideas on
   how to help your baby’s development.

     * Repeat your baby’s sounds and say simple words using those sounds. For
       example, if your baby says “bababa,” repeat “bababa,” then say “book.”
     * Place toys on the ground or on a play mat a little out of reach and
       encourage your baby to crawl, scoot, or roll to get them. Celebrate
       when she reaches them.
     * Teach your baby to wave “bye-bye” or shake his head “no.” For example,
       wave and say “bye-bye” when you are leaving. You can also teach simple
       baby sign language to help your baby tell you what he wants before he
       can use words.

     * Play games, such as peek-a-boo. You can cover your head with a cloth
       and see if your baby pulls it off.
     * Play with your baby by dumping blocks from a container and putting
       them back in together.
     * Play games with your baby, such as my turn, your turn. Try this by
       passing a toy back and forth.
     * “Read” to your baby. Reading can be talking about pictures. For
       example, while looking at books or magazines, name the pictures as you
       point to them.
     * Limit screen time (TV, tablets, phones, etc.) to video calling with
       loved ones. Screen time is not recommended for children younger than 2
       years of age. Babies learn by talking, playing, and interacting with
       others.
     * Find out about choking risks and safe foods to feed your baby. Let him
       practice feeding himself with his fingers and using a cup with a small
       amount of water. Sit next to your baby and enjoy mealtime together.
       Expect spills. Learning is messy and fun!
     * Ask for behaviors that you want. For example, instead of saying “don’t
       stand,” say “time to sit.”
     * Help your baby get used to foods with different tastes and textures.
       Foods can be smooth, mashed, or finely chopped. Your baby might not
       like every food on the first try. Give her a chance to try foods again
       and again.
     * Say a quick and cheerful goodbye instead of sneaking away so your baby
       knows you are leaving, even if he cries. He will learn to calm himself
       and what to expect. Let him know when you return by saying “Daddy’s
       back!”
     * Have routines for sleeping and feeding. Babies do better when they
       know what to expect.
     * Stay close by as your baby explores and moves around your home so she
       knows that you are near.
     * Make sure your baby gets enough sleep: 4- to 12-month-olds need 12 to
       16 hours of sleep a day (including naps). Consistent sleep times make
       it easier!
     * Take care of yourself. Parenting can be hard work! It is easier to
       enjoy your growing baby and be a loving parent when you feel good
       yourself.
     * Make it a game when your baby drops things. Hand the item back to her
       so she can drop it again.
     * Pay attention to the way he reacts to new situations and people; try
       to continue to do things that make your baby happy and comfortable.
     * Describe what your baby is looking at; for example, “red, round ball.”
     * Play a game that teaches your baby to look for things she sees you
       hide, such as a toy under a blanket.
     * Give your baby safe places to explore. Baby-proof your home. For
       example, move sharp or breakable things out of reach. Lock away
       medicines, chemicals, and cleaning products. Save the Poison Help Line
       number, 800-222-1222, in all phones.
     * Use your words, facial expressions, and voice to show what you think
       your baby is feeling (sad, mad, happy). For example, tell him “You are
       sad, let’s see if we can make you feel better.”
     * Put your baby close to things that she can pull up on safely.
