                             Welcome to Bella Baby

   Bella Baby is the face of hospital baby portraiture. We bring experienced,
   professional photographers into the hospitals to capture your baby's first
   photograph with a natural, artistic style. We believe that babies look the
   most beautiful when being held in their parents' arms or cuddled in one of
   their own baby blankets. Bella Baby captures this beauty by using only
   "real things"...natural window light, professional photographers and
   professional grade SLR digital cameras.

   Newborns aren't the only subject we love to photograph... we love to
   capture all of the milestones of family life. Using a photojournalistic
   style approach to photography, we capture your baby learning to stand,
   your 5-year old riding his bike with no training wheels, and your
   teenager's last photograph before she becomes an adult. Go to our Bella
