                       RSV in Infants and Young Children

What to know

     * RSV can be dangerous for infants and some young children.
     * RSV is the leading cause of infant hospitalization in the U.S.
     * Immunizations can protect babies from getting very sick from RSV.

Overview

   RSV can be dangerous for infants and some young children. Each year in the
   United States, an estimated 58,000–80,000 children younger than 5 years
   are hospitalized due to RSV.

   Children at greatest risk for severe illness from RSV include:

     * Infants and young children (the younger the age, the higher the risk)
     * American Indian and Alaska Native children
     * Children born prematurely
     * Children with chronic lung disease or congenital (present from birth)
       heart disease
     * Children with weakened immune systems
     * Children with severe cystic fibrosis
     * Children who have neuromuscular disorders, especially those who have
       difficulty swallowing or clearing mucus secretions

  Did you know?‎

   Nearly every child will get RSV by the time they are 2 years old.

Symptoms in infants and young children

   RSV may not be severe when it first starts. However, it can become more
   severe a few days into the illness. Early symptoms of RSV may include:

     * Runny nose
     * Eating or drinking less
     * Cough, which may progress to wheezing or difficulty breathing

  RSV in very young Infants

   Infants who get RSV almost always show symptoms. This is different from
   adults, who can sometimes get RSV and not have any symptoms. In very young
   infants (less than 6 months old), the symptoms of RSV may include:

     * Irritability
     * Decreased activity
     * Eating or drinking less
     * Apnea (pauses in breathing for more than 10 seconds)

   Many infants will not have a fever with RSV infection.

  Severe RSV

   Most of the time RSV causes a mild, cold-like illness, but it can also
   cause severe illness such as:

     * Bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung)
     * Pneumonia (infection of the lungs)

   Two to three out of every 100 infants under 6 months are hospitalized with
   RSV every year. Those who are hospitalized may require oxygen, IV fluids
   (if they aren't eating and drinking), and mechanical ventilation (a
   machine to help with breathing). Most improve with this type of supportive
   care and are discharged in a few days.

  When to seek emergency care‎

   Seek medical attention if your child is having difficulty breathing, not
   drinking enough fluids, or experiencing worsening symptoms.

Immunizations to protect infants from severe RSV

   CDC recommends you use one of these two tools to protect your baby from
   getting very sick with RSV:

     * An RSV vaccine given to the mother during pregnancy
     * An RSV immunization given to infants and some older babies

   Most infants will not need both.
