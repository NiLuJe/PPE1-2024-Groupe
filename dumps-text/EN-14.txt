   SAN ANTONIO – A man who was charged in a road rage shooting earlier this
   week is also accused of trying to purchase a 9-month-old baby and harvest
   their organs, according to San Antonio police.

   Jose Israel Teran Jr., 21, is charged with prohibition of the purchase and
   sale of human organs in addition to one count of aggravated assault with a
   deadly weapon from Monday’s shooting, records with the Bexar County Jail
   show.

   Police said that on Dec. 30, 2024, Teran was mistakingly added to a group
   text message of family members discussing the details of a 9-month-old’s
   baptism.

   According to an affidavit for his arrest, Teran, who was not part of the
   family, responded “That’s a nice Caucasian baby how much you want?”

   The creator of the group thread discovered that her uncle had changed his
   cell phone number, which was now being used by Teran.

   She told Teran “wrong number” and proceeded to block him.

   Teran continued to text in the group thread, asking, “Are you not
   interested in selling? I’m willing to start the bid at 500k,” the
   affidavit stated.

   The 9-month-old’s father called Teran, who said he purchased babies for
   their organs and was willing to pay for the baby in cash or bitcoin,
   according to the affidavit.

   Teran said he was willing to meet the same night for the purchase and
   confirmed he knew the address of the church where the baptism was
   scheduled and their home address, which was sent earlier in the group
   thread, the affidavit stated.

   When questioned about the messages, Teran told police he thought the group
   thread was spam.

    Suspect initially taken into custody for shooting

   Teran was charged earlier this week in a road rage shooting.

   SAPD said Teran was driving a sedan on Monday afternoon along Interstate
   35 northbound near the Thousand Oaks Drive exit when he pulled out a gun
   and shot a man inside a semi-truck in the leg.

   The two vehicles eventually crashed along the road. The driver of the
   semi-truck was taken to a hospital for treatment, SAPD said.

   Teran was arrested for the road rage shooting and charged with aggravated
   assault with a deadly weapon, according to a preliminary police report.
