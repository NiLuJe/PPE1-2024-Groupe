   Police Say Nurse Who Broke Preemie Babies' Bones Did Not Target Infants by
   Race

   Update 1/7/25 at 2:30pm PST

   Henrico Police Chief Eric English has stated there is no evidence that a
   former nurse accused of abusing a newborn in the NICU at Henrico Doctors'
   Hospital targeted children based on their race. The statement, issued on
   Jan. 7, addresses allegations circulating on social media and in some news
   reports suggesting racially motivated abuse by the nurse.

   The accused, 26-year-old Erin Elizabeth Ann Strotman of Chesterfield
   County, has faced claims of targeting Black infants. However, Chief
   English emphasized that such claims are “not factual” based on the
   preliminary findings of the investigation conducted by Henrico Police.

  The statement reads, 

   Henrico Police is aware of editorial social media videos discussing the
   Henrico Doctors’ Hospital NICU investigation. These individuals in the
   video claim the victims were targeted by the suspect on account of their
   race. The preliminary investigation indicates this information is not
   factual.
   As with any investigation, the Henrico County Police Division is utilizing
   all available resources to ensure a thorough investigation into this
   matter. This involves reviewing dozens of videos from inside the NICU. Due
   to the sensitive nature of these cases, specific information including
   race/gender/types of injuries, etc. is not able to be released; detectives
   do not want to compromise the investigation moving forward.
   “We understand the feelings and emotions this investigation has generated
   for our community members and beyond,” said Henrico Chief of Police Eric
   D. English. “We kindly request patience as our detectives work to
   investigate every piece of evidence in connection to these cases. The
   Henrico County Police Division is working seamlessly with our partners,
   including the Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office, to
   investigate these cases; we will not be deterred.”
   Additionally, these videos direct citizens to contact the Henrico County
   Department of Emergency Communications (DEC) to share their thoughts and
   information on the investigation. If you have information specific to this
   investigation, please contact Henrico Police at police@henrico.gov. You
   may also submit tips anonymously via Crime Stoppers at (804) 780-1000 or
   by using P3tips.com.
   Calls to the DEC are for active incidents. We respectfully ask only
   individuals who have emergency or non-emergency-related incidents to call
   the DEC.

   Authorities have urged the public to refrain from spreading unverified
   information while the investigation remains ongoing.

   Nurse.org will continue to update this article as more information becomes
   available. If you have information to share about the case - click here to

   Nurse.org editors. 

   Update 1/7/25 at 9:00am PST

   At this time, authorities have not released details on the victim's
   ethnic, racial, or gender identity. However, the father of one of the
   victims revealed a pattern that he and the other victims' parents noticed
   - he told Fox News that all of the victims are boys. "'There were all
   different injuries, and two boys had multiple injuries," he stated and
   went on to include that the parents 'can't find a pattern of why our
   babies, other than that, they were just boys.' 

   Original story 1/6/25

   A registered nurse has been arrested in connection with a disturbing case
   involving unexplained injuries to newborns in a hospital's neonatal
   intensive care unit (NICU) at Henrico Doctors' Hospital in Richmond,
   Virginia. Erin Elizabeth Ann Strotman, 26, was taken into custody and
   charged with malicious wounding and child abuse causing serious injury.

   beginning in the summer of 2023.

  Timeline of Events

     * November/December 2024: Three more babies experience similar
       unexplained fractures.
     * December 24, 2024: Hospital closes NICU to new admissions and launches
       internal investigation.
     * January 3, 2025: Strotman arrested in connection with a November 10
       incident.

   According to the Sherrif's office, Strotman is being charged with

     * CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT, SERIOUS INJURY
     * Her next court date is scheduled for 3/25/2025

   Further details include,

     * Strotman's nursing license was issued in 2019 and is valid until May
       2026.
     * The hospital implemented new safety measures, including increased
       security, surveillance systems, and an observer system for healthcare
       providers.
     * Police are reviewing hours of surveillance footage and have reopened
       previously closed cases.
     * Strotman was placed on paid leave in 2023, returned to work in late
       2024, and was terminated and then arrested on the same day last week.

   Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor shared the following
   statement about the investigation: “First, my thoughts are with the
   families of the injured children, who suffered harm while in a facility
   designed to provide comfort and care. I would also echo the remarks made
   by Chief Eric English earlier today in recognizing the dedicated work of
   the Henrico Police Division and Henrico Child Protective Services
   (Department of Social Services), as well as the staff of my office.
   Furthermore, I thank both the Virginia Department of Health and Virginia
   State Police for their assistance.”

Investigation Reveals Disturbing Pattern

   As the investigation progressed, both local police and Child Protective
   Services (CPS) became involved. Surprisingly, CPS had previously concluded
   that one of the babies, Noah Hackey, was a victim of physical abuse by an
   unnamed hospital staff member.

   The Hackeys reported that their son, Noah, suffered a mysterious fracture
   to his tibia in September 2023. The family was informed by CPS that the
   injury was due to physical abuse by a hospital staffer, though at the
   time, the identity of the perpetrator was unknown.

   The Hackeys’ received a letter from Henrico’s Department of Social
   Services with findings from a Child Protective Services investigation,
   stating:

   “Following a thorough Child Protective Services investigation, this agency
   has determined the disposition of this report to be FOUNDED, LEVEL ONE,
   for physical abuse of Noah by an employee in the Henrico Doctors’ Hospital
   NICU. A founded disposition means a review of the facts shows by a
   preponderance of the evidence that child abuse/neglect occurred. A ‘level
   one’ finding indicates the injuries/conditions, real or threatened, did or
   were likely to have resulted in serious harm to the child.”

   This finding set the stage for a more comprehensive review of cases and
   heightened scrutiny of NICU operations.

   HCA, which owns Henrico Doctor’s Hospital, said in a statement:

   "We are both shocked and saddened by this development in the investigation
   and are focused on continuing to care for our patients and providing
   support to our colleagues who have been deeply and personally impacted by
   this investigation. We are grateful to those colleagues, who have
   dedicated their professional lives to the care and safety of our patients,
   as well as to law enforcement and the other agencies who have worked
   aggressively and tirelessly with us on this investigation.” 

Enhanced Safety Measures Implemented

   In response to these incidents, Henrico Doctors' Hospital took swift
   action to enhance security and protect its patients. The hospital
   installed new surveillance systems and implemented stricter safety
   protocols. These measures included comprehensive training for staff on
   identifying and reporting signs of abuse.

   Perhaps most notably, the hospital introduced an observer system where
   each healthcare provider is now accompanied by another clinician when
   entering a baby's room. This buddy system approach aims to provide an
   additional layer of oversight and accountability in patient care.

Nurses React to the Ongoing Investigation

   The arrest of Strotman may not be the end of this case. Police are
   actively reviewing additional cases and have reopened previously closed
   cases related to these incidents. This suggests that the full scope of the
   alleged misconduct may not yet be known. As the investigation continues,
   there is a possibility that additional charges could be brought against
   Strotman.
