                                     About

   Hi! My name is Stephanie and I’m a vegan foodie from the beautiful country
   of Canada!

   I’ve been vegan for 5 years now and couldn’t imagine my life any other
   way. I started my food blog in 2020 on Instagram and TikTok as a way to
   showcase how amazing a vegan lifestyle can be! I have a passion for plant
   based nutrition and creating healthy yet delicious plant based recipes. My
   mission is to share this beautiful lifestyle with you!

My Story

   Growing up I ate a conventional ‘clean’ diet but was sucked into diet
   culture, yoyo-ing up and down with my weight. I restricted calories, never
   felt satisfied, and struggled with binge eating and fear of food. I
   thought carbs were the enemy and that I had to eat egg whites, chicken and
   veggies all day to be healthy.

   This all changed one day when I came across a speech by Gary Yourofsky
   that changed my life. I instantly lost my appetite and began to research a
   plant based diet. I was shocked by all the information I came across about
   the agriculture industry and I went vegan that day. I delved into learning
   all bout plant based nutrition and learned that carbs were not the enemy
   and that you can eat whole plant foods in abundance and still maintain a
   healthy body weight.

   I quickly realized that a plant based diet was not a diet, but a
   lifestyle. And this lifestyle was full of abundance, fresh food and
   nourishment. Although this didn’t happen overnight, my mindset gradually
   began to shift and I started to look at food as fuel for my body. My
   relationship with food started to change, my energy levels went through
   the roof, and I was feeling better than I ever had in my life! It was
   around this time that I began to start weightlifting seriously as I
   finally had the energy to stick to a workout routine.

   Veganism changed my life in so many ways. It has brought so much joy into
   my life and with the knowledge I have accumulated over the years, I feel
   obliged to share everything I have learned. That is why I have created
   this space, to help you achieve a lifestyle full of abundance, balance,
   and a love for food!

My Philosophy

   I believe that we feel our best when we fuel our body with fresh, natural,
   living, unprocessed foods. Health and wellbeing come from within and food
   is your medicine. I strongly believe that humans thrive off of eating a
   whole foods plant based diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and
   legumes.

   It is completely possible to thrive without the consumption of animal
   products, and we can actually lead healthier lives without them. By
   cutting out animal products and ultra processed foods our taste buds
   change, our bodies change and we start to crave nutrient dense foods
   instead!

   But like all good things in life, this does not happen overnight! What I
   promote is a diet rich in nutrient dense plant foods, with a healthy
   balance of carbs, protein and fats.
