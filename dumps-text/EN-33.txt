   Buckle up, parents! Your baby’s first year is a whirlwind of milestones.
   You’ve already seen them take their first breath, heard their first wail,
   and changed their first dirty diaper. (Only a couple thousand more to go,
   this year alone!)

   So what’s up next?

   Developmental milestones are behaviors and physical skills children reach
   and master as they grow. Some first-year-of-life physical milestones
   include:

     * rolling over
     * reaching for objects
     * sitting up
     * crawling

   Behavioral/social milestones include mimicking your expressions and crying
   or laughing to show emotions.

   So get your cameras ready — here are the milestones you can expect during
   your baby’s magical first year of life!

First month

   It may seem that your baby is simply an eating, pooping, and sleeping
   machine at this point. But a lot is going on in that tiny body. Milestones
   to watch for include:

     * bringing hands and fists toward mouth (though not always with great
       accuracy)
     * developing reflexes — flinching at loud sounds, shutting eyes at
       bright lights
     * focusing on objects brought within 12 feet of their face
     * turning toward familiar sounds and voices — like yours!

Second month

   Your baby is starting to act, well, more baby-like. By the end of 2
   months, your baby is likely to be:

     * gurgling/cooing
     * trying to follow movement with their eyes (called tracking), although
       it may not seem very coordinated
     * holding their head up and pushing upward with their arms while lying
       on their tummy

Third month

   Your baby is progressing from dependent newborn to more independent baby
   (yay — you might find those 5 minutes to take a shower!). This is when
   some of that cuteness overload starts to kick in. Watch for:

     * smiling at the sound of your voice (pro tip: record this and review in
       15 years to prove that there was once a time your child liked you)
     * holding their head and chest up and kicking their legs when lying on
       their stomach
     * grasping toys
     * putting their hand in their mouth with more precision
     * making more vowel sounds (ooh and ah)
     * recognizing familiar faces and objects from a distance
     * trying to imitate your facial expressions

Fourth month

   At this stage, your baby is taking the milestones already achieved and
   perfecting them. For example, they may hold their head up more
   consistently and for longer periods, grasp toys with more coordination,
   and copy your expressions with more accuracy. Other milestones are:

     * holding a rattle and shaking it at the same time
     * perhaps starting to roll from tummy to back
     * tracking movement more fluidly
     * pushing down on legs when held in standing position

Fifth month

   Your baby continues to grow, explore, and master. As their strength and
   coordination increase, you may notice that your baby is:

     * rolling from tummy to back and then back to tummy
     * grabbing their feet, and maybe even inserting them into their mouth
     * moving objects from one hand to another
     * showing interest in the food you’re eating, a sign they’re getting
       ready for solid foods

Sixth month

   Your baby’s growing up! They may now be:

     * sitting up briefly without any support
     * saying consonant (mmmm) and vowel (eeee, ooooo) sounds
     * playing and expressing displeasure when playtime stops (keep those
       raspberries coming!)
     * trying to get things out of reach
     * recognizing their name
     * expressing emotion (by crying or whining when sad or angry and
       laughing or squealing when happy)

   Given that they are now getting better and better at grasping and holding
   objects, the American Academy of Pediatrics says 6 months is a good time
   to begin to encourage your baby to use spoons and their hands to feed
   themselves. (We’re warning you: It won’t be pretty.) You can even
   introduce a sippy cup or regular cup with help.

Seventh month

   Your baby continues to build on what they’ve already learned. Milestones
   include:

     * sitting up without support for longer periods
     * responding to the word “no”
     * recognizing emotions (happy, stern, etc.) by your tone
     * using their hand like a rake to reach for something (called the
       “raking grasp”)
     * responding to expressions — smiling at a smiling face, looking
       uncertain at a fearful one
     * putting objects in their mouth to explore them (parenting tip #204:
       keep all garbage cans — and, for the love of all things sacred, diaper
       pails! — in a locked position; you’ll thank us later)
     * tracking objects more smoothly
     * stringing more consonants together while babbling

Eighth month

   You might notice that your little one can now roll over, sit up, and move
   objects from hand to hand or hand to mouth like a pro. You might also
   begin to see your baby:

     * rocking back and forth on their hands and knees or scoot along the
       floor (precursors to crawling)
     * pulling up to a standing position
     * drooling — a lot (some babies will be cutting their first teeth around
       this age)
     * continuing to babble (was that a random ma-ma or da-da you just
       heard?!)
     * developing stranger or separation anxiety — this is a kind of distress
       babies feel when they’re separated from their parents or primary
       caregivers

   Don’t worry — separation anxiety passes. We promise you’ll eventually be
   able to go to the bathroom alone again.

Ninth month

   Your baby is on the move! They may be:

     * crawling
     * more confidently pulling up to a standing position
     * playing peekaboo or looking for an object you’ve hidden
     * using the pincer grip (which involves holding a small object like a
       piece of cereal or pasta between their forefinger and thumb)
     * pointing at things they want

Tenth month

   Your baby conintues to explore and experiment. Watch your baby as they’re:

     * moving from pulling to stand or crawling to “cruising,” or walking
       while holding on to furniture or objects around a room
     * banging objects together just to hear the sound they make — a kind of
       auditory assault rivaled only by your neighbor’s garage band
     * poking at things
     * putting objects into a container and then taking them out again
     * feeding themselves finger foods
     * shaking their head “no” and waving “bye-bye”

Eleventh month

   In addition to reaching, crawling, and cruising, your baby may be:

     * continuing to explore language, giving you more mamas, dadas, and
       maybe even the occasional uh-oh! using the right inflection
     * understanding simple declaritive statements, such as “don’t touch”
     * copying your behaviors, like pushing buttons on a play phone and
       babbling to mimic converation

Twelfth month

   Congratulations! You officially have a toddler, and you’re no worse for
   wear — except for maybe that time your baby gave your hoop earring that
   really bad tug and… well, we digress.

   During their twelfth month, your baby will likely be:

     * cruising, standing briefly unsupported, and maybe even taking a step
       or two
     * exploring objects by banging, throwing, and dropping them
     * saying one or two simple words, such as hi, no, and bye
     * using objects correctly, if not clumsily (for example, using a spoon
       to eat and a comb to brush hair)
     * looking to the right object when you say, “Where’s the dog?” or
       “Where’s grandma?”

When to talk with your pediatrician

   While most babies will reach milestones at roughly (and roughly is the
   operative word here) the same age, there’s a wide range of “normal.”

   Your sister’s baby walked at 10 months and yours is still crawling at 13
   months? Normal. Your 9-month-old baby can pick up Cheerios like a vacuum
   but your neighbor’s baby the same age continues to struggle? Yep, that’s
   normal too.

   Babies born prematurely or with a health issue or congenital disorder can
   also take more time to reach milestones. And one 2018 study found that
   girls tend to reach milestones before boys (although the differences
   weren’t huge).

   All along the way, your baby’s pediatrician will be looking out for
   milestones and watching your baby’s progress. If your baby’s doctor feels
   there’s a need for intervention (screening, testing, or therapies, for
   example), they’ll let you know. And don’t shrug off your own intuition. If
   you feel something needs investigation, speak up.

   Keep your well baby appointments (typically 5 to 6 in the first year) and
   see them as an opportunity to chat with your pediatrician about what’s
   going on.

The takeaway

   Remember that the average ages for reaching certain milestones are just
   that — averages. Some babies will do things earlier, while others will do
   them later — and that’s all usually OK.

   In fact, one Swiss study published in 2013 found that children who started
   walking early (younger than the study’s average of 12 months) were neither
   more intelligent nor more coordinated by their late teen years than
   children who walked later (the latest was 20 months).

   But as always, speak to your child’s doctor if you have any concerns.
