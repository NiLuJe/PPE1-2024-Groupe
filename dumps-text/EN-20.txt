   Babe is a 1995 comedy-drama film directed by Chris Noonan, produced by
   George Miller and written by both. It is an adaptation of Dick
   King-Smith's 1983 novel The Sheep-Pig, which tells the story of a farm pig
   who wants to do the work of a sheepdog. The film is narrated by Roscoe Lee
   Browne and the main animal characters are played by both real animals and
   animatronic puppets.

   Babe was filmed in Robertson, New South Wales, in 1994 and released
   theatrically in the United States and Canada on 4 August 1995, going on to
   become a critical and commercial success with several Academy Award
   nominations.

Plot

   [edit]

   After being used in a "guess the weight" contest at a county fair,
   orphaned pig Babe is brought home to the farm of the contest winner,
   Arthur Hoggett. There he is taken in by Border Collie Fly, her irascible
   mate Rex and their puppies and befriends a duck named Ferdinand, who wakes
   people by crowing like a rooster every morning so he will be considered
   useful and be spared from being eaten.

   Dismayed when the Hoggetts buy an alarm clock, Ferdinand persuades Babe to
   help him get rid of it. In doing so, they wake Duchess, the Hoggetts' cat,
   and wreck the house in the ensuing chaos. Rex sternly instructs Babe to
   stay away from Ferdinand and the house. Seeing Fly saddened when her
   puppies are put up for sale, Babe lets her adopt him. With the Hoggett's
   relatives visiting for Christmas, Hoggett decides against choosing Babe
   for Christmas dinner, and tells his wife Esme that Babe may bring a prize
   for ham at the next county fair. Ferdinand's love interest Rosanna is
   served instead, prompting Ferdinand to escape the farm. Babe investigates
   the fields, where he witnesses a pair of sheep rustlers stealing Hoggett's
   sheep and quickly alerts Fly and the farmer, preventing the rustlers from
   taking the whole flock.

   Impressed after seeing Babe sort hens, separating the brown from the white
   ones, Hoggett takes him to try and herd the sheep. Encouraged by an
   elderly ewe named Maa, Babe gets the sheep to cooperate by asking nicely,
   but Rex perceives Babe's actions as an insult to sheepdogs. When Fly
   stands up for Babe, Rex attacks and injures her and bites Hoggett's hand
   when he tries to intervene. Rex is subsequently chained to the dog house
   and sedated, leaving the sheep herding job to Babe. One morning, Babe
   scares off a trio of feral dogs attacking the sheep, but Maa is mortally
   injured and dies as a result. Hoggett, thinking Babe was responsible,
   prepares to shoot him, but Fly finds out the truth from the other sheep
   and distracts Hoggett long enough for Esme to inform him about the dogs'
   attacks on neighboring farms.

   When Esme leaves on a trip, Hoggett signs Babe up for a local sheep
   herding competition. As it is raining the night before, Hoggett lets him
   and Fly into the house, where he is scratched by Duchess, who in turn is
   temporarily confined outside as punishment. When she is let back in later,
   she gets revenge on Babe by revealing that humans consume pigs. After
   learning from Fly that this is true, Babe runs away and Rex finds him the
   next morning in a cemetery. Hoggett brings a demoralized Babe home, where
   he refuses to eat. Hoggett feeds him from a baby bottle, sings "If I Had
   Words" and dances a jig for him, restoring Babe's faith in Hoggett's
   affection.

   At the competition, Babe meets the sheep that he will be herding, but they
   ignore his attempts to speak to them. As Hoggett is criticized by the
   bemused judges and ridiculed by the public for using a pig instead of a
   dog, Rex runs back to the farm to ask the sheep what to do. After
   promising he will treat them better from now on, the sheep disclose to him
   a secret password. He returns in time to convey the password to Babe, and
   the sheep now follow his instructions flawlessly. Amid the crowd's
   acclamation, Babe is unanimously given a perfect score. When Babe sits
   down next to the farmer, Hoggett praises him with the standard command to
   sheep dogs that their job is done, "That'll do, Pig. That'll do."

Production

   [edit]

   Babe is an adaptation of Dick King-Smith's 1983 novel The Sheep-Pig, also
   known as Babe: The Gallant Pig in the US, which tells the story of a pig
   raised as livestock who wants to do the work of a sheepdog. The main
   animal characters are played by a combination of real and animatronic pigs
   and Border Collies.^[4] The breed of pig used was a Large White, which
   grows rapidly. On account of this, 46 piglets of the required size were
   used during the course of the filming,^[5] as well as the animatronic
   model for visual effects.

   The film is divided into six chapters to preserve the storybook-like feel
   of the original novel (although none of the film's chapters are the same
   as the book's). The film's mice characters were subsequently added to read
   the chapter titles aloud after a test screening in which producer George
   Miller noted that younger audiences had trouble reading them, needing help
   from the adults.

   After seven years of development,^[6] Babe was filmed in Robertson, New
   South Wales, Australia.^[7] The talking-animal visual effects were done by
   Rhythm & Hues Studios (R&H), Animal Logic and Jim Henson's Creature Shop.

   According to actor James Cromwell, there was tension on the set between
   producer George Miller and director Chris Noonan.^[8] Noonan later
   complained, "I don't want to make a lifelong enemy of George Miller but I
   thought that he tried to take credit for Babe, tried to exclude me from
   any credit, and it made me very insecure... It was like your guru has told
   you that you are no good and that is really disconcerting."^[9]

   Miller shot back, "Chris said something that is defamatory: that I took
   his name off the credits on internet sites, which is just absolutely
   untrue. You know, I'm sorry but I really have a lot more to do with my
   life than worry about that... when it comes to Babe, the vision was handed
   to Chris on a plate."^[10]

   Interviewed about the movie in 2020, Cromwell admitted he nearly turned it
   down, as his character only had about 16 lines. He was persuaded by his
   friend Charles Keating to take it anyway. Keating told him: "it's a free
   ticket to Australia, and if the movie tanks, it's not your fault, it's the
   pig's fault." Cromwell said Noonan wanted him for the part, and won out
   over Miller, who had wanted to cast an Australian actor. Cromwell's fee
   was around $50,000. He asked for an increase when he realised the movie
   was making millions of dollars, but was turned down. Nevertheless, he said
   "I got a lot out of that film, and it turned my whole life around. I
   didn't have to audition anymore."^[11]

   In 1998, a sequel directed by Miller, Babe: Pig in the City, was released,
   but it failed to achieve the same success as the first film.^[12] In 2006,
   a video game based on the original film was published by Mastertronic
   Group for the PlayStation 2.^[13]

Music

   [edit]

   The musical score for Babe was composed by Nigel Westlake and performed by
   the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Classical orchestral music by
   19th-century French composers is used throughout the film, but is
   disguised in a variety of ways and often integrated by Westlake into his
   score. The theme song "If I Had Words" (lyrics by Jonathan Hodge), sung by
   Hoggett near the film's conclusion, is an adaptation of the Maestoso final
   movement of the Organ Symphony by Camille Saint-Saëns, and was originally
   performed in 1977 by Scott Fitzgerald and Yvonne Keeley. This tune also
   recurs throughout the film's score.^[14]

   There are also brief quotations within the score from Edvard Grieg's Lyric
   Pieces, Op.71 No. 1. Other music featured is by Léo Delibes, Richard
   Rodgers, Gabriel Fauré, and Georges Bizet.

Reception

   [edit]

   Babe was a box office success, grossing A$36.7 million (US$29 million) at
   the box office in Australia;^[15] US$64 million in the United States and
   Canada; US$34 million in the United Kingdom and over US$254 million
   worldwide.^[3] It was the second highest-grossing Australian film in
   Australia, behind Crocodile Dundee.^[16] It also received critical acclaim
   and was ultimately nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best
   Picture,^[17] Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for James Cromwell,
   Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, Best
   Art Direction and Best Film Editing, winning Best Visual Effects.^[18] At
   the APRA Music Awards of 1996 it won Best Film Score for Westlake's
   work.^[19] In 2006, the American Film Institute named Babe #80 on its list
   of America's Most Inspiring Movies.^[20] On review aggregator website
   Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 70
   reviews, with a rating average of 8.26/10. The website's critical
   consensus reads: "The rare family-friendly feature with a heart as big as
   its special effects budget, Babe offers timeless entertainment for viewers
   of all ages."^[21] Metacritic gave the film a score of 83 based on 16
   reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".^[22]

   Because of its subject being a piglet, Babe was initially banned from
   Malaysia in order to avoid upsetting or annoying Muslims (who view pigs as
   haram). The ruling was overturned almost a year later, and the film was
   released direct-to-video.^[23]

   When Babe was released in the US, it is reported that "activists around
   the country staked out movie theaters with flyers documenting the
   real-life abuses of pigs".^[24] The film had a marked effect on the growth
   of vegetarianism, particularly among the young. It also promoted a more
   sympathetic view of the intellectual, emotional and social capacities of
   animals.^[25] James Cromwell became an ethical vegetarian as a result of
   starring as Farmer Hoggett, saying: "I decided that to be able to talk
   about this [movie] with conviction, I needed to become a vegetarian."^[26]
   In 1996, he went on to organize a vegetarian dinner for the Los Angeles
   homeless at a "Compassionate Christmas" event^[27] in order to reverse the
   barnyard view that "Christmas is carnage".
