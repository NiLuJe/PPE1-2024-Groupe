The Joke of the Day!

   What is the difference between girls aged: 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58 and 68?

   At 8 – You take her to bed and tell her a story.
   At 18 – You tell her a story and take her to bed.
   At 28 – You don’t need to tell her a story to take her to bed.
   At 38 – She tells you a story and takes you to bed.
   At 48 – You tell her a story to avoid going to bed.
   At 58 – You stay in bed to avoid her story.
   At 68 – If you take her to bed, that’ll be a story!

   I have had to stop going on vacation to the Caribbean. Every time I would
   vacation there, I would get in a bad mood and not want to go out and do
   anything.

   I went to my doctor and he said I had a tropical depression.
