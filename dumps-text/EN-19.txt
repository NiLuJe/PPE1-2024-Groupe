Magic Dance Lyrics

   [Intro]
   You remind me of the babe (What babe?)
   The babe with the power (What power?)
   The power of voodoo (Who do?)
   You do (Do what?)
   Remind me of the babe

   [Verse 1]
   I saw my baby
   Crying hard as babe could cry
   What could I do?
   My baby's love had gone
   And left my baby blue
   Nobody knew

   [Pre-Chorus]
   What kind of magic spell to use?
   (Slime and snails?)
   Or puppy dog tails?
   (Thunder or lightning?)
   Then baby said

   [Chorus]
   (Dance, magic dance) Dance, magic dance
   (Dance, magic dance) Dance, magic dance
   Put that baby's spell on me
   (Jump, magic jump) Jump, magic jump
   (Jump, magic jump) Jump, magic jump
   Put that magic jump on me
   Slap that baby, make him free!

   [Verse 2]
   I saw my baby
   Trying hard as babe could try
   What could I do?
   My baby's fun had gone
   And left my baby blue
   Nobody knew

   [Pre-Chorus]
   What kind of magic spell to use?
   (Slime and snails?)
   Puppy dogs' tails?
   (Thunder or lightning?)
   Then baby said

   [Chorus]
   (Dance, magic dance) Dance, magic dance
   (Dance, magic dance) Dance, magic dance
   Put that baby's spell on me
   (Jump, magic jump) Jump, magic jump
   (Jump, magic jump) Jump, magic jump
   Put that magic jump on me
   Slap that baby, make him free!
   (Dance, magic dance) Dance, magic dance
   (Dance, magic dance) Dance, magic dance
   Put that baby's spell on me
   [Bridge 1]
   You remind me of the babe (What babe?)
   The babe with the power (What power?)
   The power of voodoo (Who do?)
   You do (Do what?)
   Remind me of the babe
   Dance, magic dance, ooh-ooh-ooh
   Dance, magic

   [Bridge 2]
   What kind of magic spell to use?
   Slime and snails?
   Or puppy dog tails?
   Thunder or lightning?
   Something frightening?

   [Chorus]
   Dance, magic dance
   Dance, magic dance
   Put that baby's spell on me
   Jump, magic jump
   Jump, magic jump
   Put that magic jump on me
   Slap that baby, make him free

   [Alt. Chorus]
   Dance, magic dance (Dance, magic dance)
   Dance, magic dance (Dance, magic dance)
   Dance, magic dance (Dance, magic dance)
   Dance, magic dance (Dance, magic dance)
   Jump, magic jump (Jump, magic jump)
   Jump, magic jump
   Put that magic jump on me
   Slap that baby, slap that
   Slap that baby, make him free
   [Outro]
   Dance, magic dance (Dance, magic dance)
   Dance, magic dance (Dance, magic dance)
   Dance, magic dance (Dance, magic dance)
   Dance, magic dance (Dance, magic dance)
   Dance, magic dance (Dance, magic dance)
   Dance, magic dance (Dance, magic dance)

   How to Format Lyrics:

     * Type out all lyrics, even repeating song parts like the chorus
     * Lyrics should be broken down into individual lines
     * Use section headers above different song parts like [Verse], [Chorus],
       etc.
     * Use italics (<i>lyric</i>) and bold (<b>lyric</b>) to distinguish
       between different vocalists in the same song part
     * If you don‚Äôt understand a lyric, use [?]
