   [IMG]Water is poured on the head of an infant held over the baptismal font
   of a Roman Catholic church.

   Infant baptism^[1]^[2] (or paedobaptism) is the practice of baptizing
   infants or young children. Infant baptism is also called christening by
   some faith traditions.

   Most Christians belong to denominations that practice infant baptism.
   Branches of Christianity that practice infant baptism include
   Catholicism,^[3] Eastern Orthodoxy,^[4] and Oriental Orthodoxy.^[5] Among
   Protestants, several denominations practice infant baptism including
   Anglicans,^[6] Lutherans,^[7] Presbyterians,^[8] Congregationalists,^[9]
   Methodists,^[10] Nazarenes,^[11] Moravians,^[12] and United
   Protestants.^[13]

   Christians who do not practice infant baptism are called credobaptists.

Ceremony

   [edit]

   The exact details of the baptismal ceremony vary among Christian
   denominations. Many follow a prepared ceremony, called a rite or liturgy.
   In a typical ceremony, parents or godparents bring their child to their
   congregation's priest or minister. The rite used would be the same as that
   denomination's rite for adults, i.e., by pouring holy water (affusion) or
   by sprinkling water (aspersion). Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic
   traditions practice total immersion and baptize babies in a font, and this
   practice is also the first method listed in the baptismal ritual of the
   Roman Catholics, although pouring is the standard practice within the
   Latin branch of Catholicism. Catholic and Orthodox churches that do this
   do not sprinkle. At the moment of baptism, the minister utters the words
   "I baptize you (or, "The servant of God (name) is baptized") in the name
   of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" (see Matthew
   28:19).^[14]^[better source needed]

   Although it is not required, many parents and godparents choose to dress
   the baby in a white gown called a christening gown for the baptism
   ceremony. Christening gowns often become treasured keepsakes that are used
   by many other children in the family and handed down from generation to
   generation. Traditionally, this gown is white or slightly off white and
   made with much lace, trim and intricate detail. In the past, a gown was
   used for both boys and girls; in the present day it has become more common
   to dress children in a baptismal outfit. Also normally made of white
   fabric, the outfit consists of a romper with a vest or other accessories.
   These clothes are often kept as a memento after the ceremony.^[citation

History

   [edit]

  Antiquity

   [edit]
   See also: Ritual purification § Christianity

   Scholars disagree on the date when infant baptism was first practiced.
   Some believe that 1st-century Christians did not practice it, noting the
   lack of any explicit evidence of infant baptism.^[15] Others, noting the
   lack of any explicit evidence of exclusion of infant baptism, believe that
   they did, understanding biblical references to individuals "and [her]
   household" being baptized^[16] as including young children.^[17]

   The earliest extrabiblical directions for baptism,^[18] which occur in the
   Didache (c. 100),^[19] are taken to be about baptism of adults, since they
   require fasting by the person to be baptized.^[20] However, inscriptions
   dating back to the 2nd century which refer to young children as "children
   of God" may indicate that Christians customarily baptized infants
   too.^[21] The earliest reference to infant baptism was by Irenaeus (c.
   130–202) in his work Against Heresies.^[22]^[23] Due to its reference to
   Eleutherus as the current bishop of Rome, the work is usually dated
   c. 180.^[24] Irenaeus speaks of children being "born again to
   God."^[25]^[26] Three passages by Origen (185–c. 254)^[27]^[28] mention
   infant baptism as traditional and customary.^[29] Also Augustine of Hippo
   referred the baptism of children as an apostolic tradition.^[30]

   While Tertullian writing c. 198–203 advises the postponement of baptism of
   little children and the unmarried, he mentions that it was customary to
   baptize infants, with sponsors speaking on their behalf.^[31] The
   Apostolic Tradition, sometimes attributed to Hippolytus of Rome (died
   235), describes how to perform the ceremony of baptism; it states that
   children were baptized first, and if any of them could not answer for
   themselves, their parents or someone else from their family was to answer
   for them.^[32]

   From at least the 3rd century onward Christians baptized infants as
   standard practice, although some preferred to postpone baptism until late
   in life so as to ensure forgiveness for all their preceding sins.^[33]

Theology

   [edit]

  Agreements among infant baptizers

   [edit]

   Based on their understanding of New Testament passages such as Colossians
   2:11–12, Christians who baptize infants believe that infant baptism is the
   New Testament counterpart to the Old Testament circumcision. In the Old
   Testament, all male converts to Judaism, male infants born to Jewish
   parents, and male servants were circumcised as ceremony of initiation into
   the Jewish community.^[34] Christians who baptize infants believe that
   baptism has replaced Old Testament circumcision and is the religious
   ceremony of initiation into the Christian community.^[35]

   During the medieval and Reformation eras, infant baptism was seen as a way
   to incorporate newborn babies into the secular community as well as
   inducting them into the Christian faith.^[36] Due to high rates of infant
   mortality, it is important to note that canon law denied unbaptized
   infants a Christian burial in sacred ground.^[37]

  Teachings of Christian denominations practicing infant baptism

   [edit]
   [IMG]
   Baptism by immersion in the Eastern Orthodox Church
   (Sophia Cathedral, 2005)

   Different Christian denominations who practice infant baptism attach
   different meanings to the sacrament and explain its efficacy in different
   ways.

    Catholic Church

   [edit]

   The Catholic Church considers baptism, even for an infant, so important
   that "parents are obliged to see that their infants are baptized within
   the first few weeks" and, "if the infant is in danger of death, it is to
   be baptized without any delay."^[38] It declares: "The practice of infant
   Baptism is an immemorial tradition of the Church. There is explicit
   testimony to this practice from the second century on, and it is quite
   possible that, from the beginning of the apostolic preaching, when whole
   'households' received baptism, infants may also have been baptized".^[39]
   It notes that "when the first direct evidence of infant Baptism appears in
   the second century, it is never presented as an innovation", that
   2nd-century Irenaeus^[40] treated baptism of infants as a matter of
   course, and that, "at a Synod of African Bishops, St. Cyprian stated that
   'God's mercy and grace should not be refused to anyone born', and the
   Synod, recalling that 'all human beings' are 'equal', whatever be 'their
   size or age', declared it lawful to baptize children 'by the second or
   third day after their birth'".^[41] In the 17th and 18th centuries, many
   infants were baptized on the day of their birth as in the cases of
   Francoise-Athenais, Marquise de Montespan, Jeanne Du Barry and Marie Anne
   de Cupis de Camargo. Infant baptism is seen as showing very clearly that
   salvation is an unmerited favor from God, not the fruit of human
   effort.^[42] "Born with a fallen human nature and tainted by original sin,
   children also have need of the new birth in Baptism to be freed from the
   power of darkness and brought into the realm of the freedom of the
   children of God, to which all men are called ... The Church and the
   parents would deny a child the priceless grace of becoming a child of God
   were they not to confer Baptism shortly after birth".^[43]

   The church has no dogmatic official teaching regarding the fate of infants
   who die without baptism, and theologians of the church hold various views
   (in particular, many have asserted that they go to Limbo). "The Church
   entrusts these infants to the mercy of God."^[44]

   The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued on 20 October 1980
   an instruction on infant baptism, whose purpose was "to recall the
   principal points of doctrine in this field which justify the Church's
   constant practice down the centuries and demonstrate its permanent value
   in spite of the difficulties raised today". The document then indicated
   some general guidelines for pastoral action.^[45]

   The document recalled that infant baptism has long been considered of
   apostolic origin, and that the first direct evidence of its practice,
   dating from the 2nd century, does not present it as an innovation. It then
   responded to objections that baptism should follow faith, that the person
   baptized should consciously receive the grace of the sacrament, that the
   person should freely accept baptism, that infant baptism is unsuitable in
   a society marked by instability of values and conflicts of ideas, and that
   the practice is inimical to a missionary outlook on the part of the
   church.^[46]

   The instruction then gave guidelines for pastoral practice, based on two
   principles. The major principle is that baptism, as the sign and means of
   God's love that precedes any action on our part and that frees from
   original sin and communicates divine life, must not be delayed. The
   subordinate principle is that assurances must be given that the gift thus
   granted can grow by authentic education in the faith and Christian life.
   If these assurances are not really serious, there can be grounds for
   delaying baptism. If they are certainly absent, the sacrament should even
   be refused.^[47]

   Accordingly, the rules for involvement on the part of practicing Christian
   parents must be supplemented with other considerations in the case of
   "families with little faith or non-Christian families". If these request
   that a child of theirs be baptized, there must be assurances that the
   child will be given the benefit of the Christian upbringing required by
   the sacrament. Examples of such assurances are "the choice of godparents
   who will take sincere care of the child, or the support of the community".
   If there is satisfactory assurance, i.e., "any pledge giving a
   well-founded hope for the Christian upbringing of the children", then "the
   priest cannot refuse to celebrate the sacrament without delay, as in the
   case of children of Christian families". If there is insufficient
   assurance, "it will be prudent to delay baptism", while keeping contact
   with the parents in the hope of securing the required conditions for
   celebrating the sacrament. As a last resort, enrollment of the child in a
   course of catechetical instruction on reaching school age can be offered
   in lieu of immediate celebration of baptism.^[48] The possibility of
   delaying infant baptism in the case of non practicing or non believing
   parents raises a number of questions. How can we discern that there are
   guarantees of an authentic Christian education? Can a priest propose an
   alternative celebration in the case where baptism is to be delayed? In
   some German speaking countries, bishops have opened the door to a "two
   step baptism", i.e. two celebrations separated by a time of evangelization
   of the parents. In this case, the rite of baptism itself is to be
   performed in the second celebration, when parents are supposed to have
   enough maturity to raise the child in the Catholic faith.^[49]

   The Catechism of the Catholic Church states: "Since Baptism signifies
   liberation from sin and from its instigator the devil, one or more
   exorcisms are pronounced over the candidate".^[50] In the Roman Rite, the
   wording of the prayer of exorcism is: "Almighty and ever-living God, you
   sent your only Son into the world to cast out the power of Satan, spirit
   of evil, to rescue man from the kingdom of darkness and bring him into the
   splendour of your kingdom of light. We pray for this child: set him (her)
   free from original sin, make him (her) a temple of your glory, and send
   your Holy Spirit to dwell with him (her). Through Christ our Lord."^[51]

    Eastern Churches

   [edit]
   [IMG]Christening photograph showing the oil moment and Baptism in Greek
   Orthodox Church

   The Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and the Assyrian Church of
   the East also insist on the need to have infants baptized as soon as is
   practicable after birth. Similar to the Catholic Church, they teach that
   baptism is not merely a symbol but actually conveys grace. Baptism is a
   sacrament because it is an "instrument" instituted by Jesus Christ to
   impart grace to its recipients. Infants are traditionally baptized on the
   eighth day,^[52] recalling the biblical injunction to circumcise on the
   eighth day. However, this is not mandatory. In many of these churches, the
   Sacred Mystery of Chrismation (Confirmation) is administered by the priest
   immediately after baptism. Holy Communion, in the form of consecrated wine
   and bread, is also given to infants after they are baptized.^[53]

    Lutheran Churches

   [edit]
   [IMG]German reformer Philipp Melanchthon baptizing an infant

   Lutherans practice infant baptism because they believe that God mandates
   it through the instruction of Jesus Christ, "Go and make disciples of all
   nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
   the Holy Spirit",^[54] in which Jesus does not set any age limit:

     The command is general. It includes infants, women, men, and teenagers,
     even though none of these groups is specifically named. Each of these
     groups is included in "all nations."^[55]

   They also cite other biblical passages such as Mark 10:13-15, Mark 16:16,
   John 3:3-7 and Acts 2:38-39^[56] in support of their position. For
   example, in the Acts of the Apostles Peter's teachings on Pentecost
   included children in the promise of baptism, "Repent and be baptized,
   every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your
   sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for
   you and your children".^[55]

   For them baptism is a "means of grace" through which God creates and
   strengthens "saving faith"^[57]^[58] as the "washing of regeneration"^[59]
   in which people are reborn (John 3:3–7): "baptismal regeneration". Since
   the creation of faith is exclusively God's work, it does not depend on the
   actions of the one baptized, whether infant or adult. Even though baptized
   infants cannot articulate that faith, Lutherans believe that it is present
   all the same.^[60] Because it is faith alone that receives these divine
   gifts, Lutherans confess that baptism "works forgiveness of sins, delivers
   from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe
   this, as the words and promises of God declare".^[61] In the special
   section on infant baptism in his Large Catechism Luther argues that infant
   baptism is God-pleasing because persons so baptized were reborn and
   sanctified by the Holy Spirit.^[62]

     Lutherans [WELS] believe that babies are conceived and born sinful^[63]
     and therefore need to be born again to enter the kingdom of heaven.^[64]
     Through Baptism, the Holy Spirit works rebirth,^[65] creates faith in
     them, and saves them.^[66] Although some deny the possibility of infant
     faith, the Bible clearly teaches that babies can believe.^[67]^[55]

    Methodist Churches

   [edit]
   Further information: Covenant theology § Wesleyan covenant theology
   [IMG]A baptistry in a Methodist church

   In the Methodist Churches, baptism is a sacrament of initiation into the
   visible church.^[68] Wesleyan covenant theology further teaches that
   baptism is a sign and a seal of the covenant of grace:^[69]

     Of this great new-covenant blessing, baptism was therefore eminently the
     sign; and it represented "the pouring out" of the Spirit, "the
     descending" of the Spirit, the "falling" of the Spirit "upon men," by
     the mode in which it was administered, the pouring of water from above
     upon the subjects baptized. As a seal, also, or confirming sign, baptism
     answers to circumcision.^[69]

   Infant baptism, in Methodism, is celebrated as "an acceptance of the
   prevenient grace of God and as a confession on the part of the church of
   its responsibility for children in general and for every child in
   particular."^[70]^[10] Methodists teach that people receive justifying
   grace, which is integral to salvation, after they repent and personally
   accept Jesus as Savior.^[71]^[72] Many Methodist denominations, such as
   the Free Methodist Church and Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection,
   practice infant baptism for families who desire it for their children, but
   provide a rite for child dedication for those who have a preference for
   credobaptism only after their child has made a personal acceptance of
   Jesus as his/her savior.^[72]^[73]

    Presbyterian, Congregational and Reformed Churches

   [edit]

   Presbyterian, Congregational and Reformed Christians believe that baptism,
   whether of infants or adults, is a "sign and seal of the covenant of
   grace", and that baptism admits the party baptized into the visible
   church.^[74] Being a member of the visible church does not guarantee
   salvation; though it does provide the child with many benefits, including
   that of one's particular congregation consenting to assist in the raising
   of that child in "the way he should go, (so that) when he is old he will
   not turn from it". Elect infants (those predestined for salvation) who die
   in infancy are by faith considered regenerate on the basis of God's
   covenant promises in the covenant of grace.^[75]

   Presbyterian, Congregational and many Reformed Christians see infant
   baptism as the New Testament form of circumcision in the Jewish
   covenant.^[76] Circumcision did not create faith in the 8-day-old Jewish
   boy. It merely marked him as a member of God's covenant people Israel.
   Likewise, baptism does not create faith; it is a sign of membership in the
   visible covenant community.^[77]

   Presbyterian, Congregational and Reformed Christians consider children of
   professing Christians to be members of the visible church (the covenant
   community). They also consider them to be full members of the local
   congregation where their parents are members and members of the universal
   church (the set of all true believers who make up the invisible church)
   unless and until they prove otherwise. Baptism is the mark of membership
   in the covenant of grace and in the universal church, although
   regeneration is not inseparably connected with baptism.^[78]

  Contrasts between infant and adult baptism

   [edit]

   Infant baptism can be contrasted with what is called "believer's baptism"
   (or credobaptism, from the Latin word credo meaning "I believe"), which is
   the religious practice of baptizing only individuals who personally
   confess faith in Jesus, therefore excluding underage children.^[79]

   Pedobaptism and credobaptism are positions which bubble up from
   theological views at a more fundamental level of one's theological system.

     * If baptism is a sign that a person is a member of God's covenant
       community, and if the children of believers are members of that
       community, it follows that the children of believers should receive
       the sign that they are members of God's covenant community by being
       baptized, as an infant is entitled to a passport that indicates the
       child as a member of a particular country.^[80]
     * Believers and the children of believers become members of God's
       covenant community (or church) through baptism.^[81]
     * It is believed by some Christians that in the heart of a baptized
       child, faith as a gift or grace from God, as distinct from an act by
       the person, is made present.^[82]
     * It is believed by some Christians that baptism is not merely a symbol
       and that it has a real effect, conveying divine grace.^[83]

  Arguments for infant baptism

   [edit]

   Christians who practice infant baptism do not completely agree on the
   reasons for doing so, and offer different reasons in support of the
   practice. Among the arguments made in support of the practice are:

     * Analogy with circumcision: Some Christians posit an analogy of baptism
       to circumcision, pointing to children, since the historic Israelite
       application of circumcision was to infants, not to adult converts, of
       which there were few. Covenant theology identifies baptism less as a
       statement of faith than as an assumption of identity; that is to say
       that infant baptism is a sign of covenantal inclusion.^[84] Assuming
       that what God instituted in the Old Testament continues unless the New
       Testament specifically abrogates it, including infants in the giving
       of the sign of the covenant must continue in the New Covenant. It is
       especially so if the practice is an important one.^[85]
     * Jesus' affirmation: According to Luke 18:15-17, when parents brought
       their babies to Jesus, the disciples tried to prevent them from
       coming. Jesus becomes indignant and says, "Let the little children
       come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to
       such as these." This seems to confirm that infants can have a personal
       relationship with Jesus just as parents can have a personal
       relationship with their babies. More importantly, Jesus confirms that
       babies of believers belong to the kingdom of God. In other words,
       babies of believers are counted as believers, not unbelievers.
       Therefore, Jesus specifically instructs not to hinder them.^[86]
     * Peter's speech: According to the Book of Acts, "Peter replied, 'Repent
       and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the
       forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy
       Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are
       far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.'" (Acts 2:38–39,
       NIV–UK, emphasis added)^[87] Some churches within The United Methodist
       Church argue that the phrase "every one of you" recalls the use of the
       same phrase in Deuteronomy 29:10–12,^[88] where there is explicit
       mention of the "little ones" present; and it takes the phrase "and
       your children" to mean that Peter included children in the covenant
       community.^[89]
     * Early Christian practice: Several early Church Fathers seem to have
       taught that infant baptism is proper; Origen states that the practice
       of baptizing infants is of apostolic origin.^[90]

  Arguments against infant baptism

   [edit]
     * Infants cannot repent or believe: Baptism in Scripture always has the
       prerequisite of repentance and faith, which are impossible for an
       infant.^[91]^[92]
     * No scriptural instances: There are no explicit instances of infant
       baptism in the scripture^[91]

    Denominations and religious groups opposed to infant baptism

   [edit]

   Trinitarian Christian denominations that oppose infant baptism include the
   International Christian Church, all Baptist and Anabaptist traditions and
   denominations, Pentecostals, Assemblies of God and more.^[93]

   Several nontrinitarian religious groups also oppose infant baptism,
   including Oneness Pentecostals, Christadelphians, Jehovah's Witnesses,
   United Church of God, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
   Saints.^[94]

   B.R. White describes the motivations behind persecution of the Anabaptists
   during the Reformation as follows:

     Other Christians saw the baptism of each new-born baby into the secular
     parish community and close links between church and state as the
     divinely-ordained means of holding society together. Hence many other
     Christians saw the Anabaptists as subversive of all order. Consequently,
     from the earliest days, they were sharply persecuted and leaders were
     soon executed.^[95]

   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) completely
   rejects infant baptism.^[94] Little children are considered both born
   without sin^[96] and incapable of committing sin.^[97] They have no need
   of baptism until age eight,^[98] when they can begin to learn to discern
   right from wrong, and are thus accountable to God for their own
   actions.^[99] However, the LDS Church performs a non-saving ordinance to
   name and bless children, customarily performed on infants.^[100]

Confirmation

   [edit]

   For Roman Catholic, Methodist Christians, and Weslian Confirmation
   "strengthens" (the original meaning of the word "confirm")^[101]^[102] the
   grace of Baptism, by conferring an increase and deepening of that
   grace.^[103]^[102]

   In Eastern Christianity, including the Eastern Catholic Churches, the
   sacrament of Confirmation is conferred immediately after baptism, and
   there is no renewal of baptismal promises. In the Latin Church and its
   Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic Church, the sacrament is to be
   conferred at about the age of discretion (generally taken to be about 7),
   unless the Episcopal Conference has decided on a different age, or there
   is danger of death or, in the judgment of the minister, a grave reason
   suggests otherwise (canon 891 of the Code of Canon Law). The renewal of
   baptismal promises by those receiving the sacrament in the Western
   Catholic Church is incidental to the rite and not essentially different
   from the solemn renewal of their baptismal promises that is asked of all
   members of this church each year at the Easter Vigil service. Only in
   French-speaking countries has there been a development of ceremonies,
   quite distinct from the sacrament of Confirmation, for young Catholics to
   profess their faith publicly, in line with their age.^[104]

   Within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, confirmation or
   "the laying on of hands" is an essential part of the baptismal ordinance,
   and to receive baptism without confirmation is to leave the ordinance
   incomplete.^[105] Confirmation is the conferring of the gift of the Holy
   Ghost as a constant companion.^[106] To confirm means to "make more sure"
   and the ordinance of confirmation stands as a witness of the individual
   becoming a member of the LDS Church and not just an acceptance of
   Jesus.^[105]

Opposition to infant baptism

   [edit]

   According to Catholic legal professor and former Irish president Mary
   McAleese, as outlined in her doctoral thesis, infant baptism amounts to
   "enforced membership of the Catholic Church", which violates fundamental
   rights of children. These "infant conscripts ... are held to lifelong
   obligations of obedience" without their understanding or consent. "Parents
   can guide and direct [their children] but they can't impose, and what the
   church has failed to do is to recognize that there has to be a point at
   which our young people, as adults who have been baptized into the church
   and raised in the faith, have the chance to say 'I validate this' or 'I
   repudiate this'. You and I know, we live now in times where we have the
   right to freedom of conscience, freedom of belief, freedom of opinion,
   freedom of religion and freedom to change religion. The Catholic Church
   yet has to fully embrace that thinking."^[107]

  Controversies

   [edit]

   Baptisms have sometimes accidentally led to injuries, or deaths, such as
   drowning deaths, to babies.^[108]^[109] In Romania, this has served as an
   opportunity to revise practices.^[110]

Yazidi baptism

   [edit]
   [IMG]Baptism of a Yazidi child in Lalish

   In Yazidism, children are baptized at birth and circumcision is not
   required, but is practiced by some due to regional customs.^[111] The
   Yazidi baptism is called Mor kirin (literally: 'to seal'). Traditionally,
   Yazidi children are baptized at birth with water from the Kaniya Sipî
   ('White Spring') at Lalish. It involves pouring holy water from the spring
   on the child's head three times.^[112]^[113]

       prayers include clear requests that God will bring the children to a
       personal faith that "owns" what the parents are promising at a time
       when the children (who "belong" from day one) cannot act for
       themselves. And when they dedicate children, pastors should make sure
       that their prayers include clear gratitude to God for the fact that he
       is already at work in the life of that child, who already "belongs" in
       the Christian community. Here's what must be stressed: whether at the
       time of baptism (in the adult baptism tradition) or at the time of
       confirmation when the vows made earlier by the parents are personally
       "owned" (in the infant baptism tradition), it is faith in Jesus
       (dependent trust, not mere cognitive affirmation) that is crucial.
       Paul goes so far as to say that without faith and obedience, the old
       rite of circumcision has no value (Romans 2:25). The same is true of
       baptism. With either rite, clear evangelistic follow-through is
       crucial.
