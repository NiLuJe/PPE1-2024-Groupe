   Babe Ruth died on August 16, 1948, from a type of throat cancer. He
   underwent hormone therapy, and surgery in an attempt to treat his cancer.
   He was also one of the first cancer patients to receive sequential
   radiation and chemotherapy treatment. The treatments were not successful.

   His funeral took place over three days, from August 17 to August 19, 1948.
   Ruth was a well-known Major League Baseball player who played for the New
   York Yankees for fifteen years. His funeral included a two-day open casket
   funeral at Yankee Stadium, a mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral and a burial
   at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery. The funeral events were attended by many
   prominent people. A total of 57 honorary pallbearers were appointed for
   his funeral.

   While Ruth's body was lying in state at Yankee Stadium it was estimated
   that 100,000 fans came to pay their respects at St. Patrick's Cathedral in
   New York City. Police estimated that 80,000 people stood outside as his
   cortege arrived for a requiem delivered by Cardinal Francis Spellman.
   After the requiem, approximately 100,000 people lined the 30 mi (48 km)
   route to the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York.

Illness and death

   [edit]
   [IMG]Babe Ruth Bows Out, Nat Fein's Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of
   Ruth, two months before his death

   In 1946, Ruth began to experience severe pain over his left eye and had
   difficulty swallowing. Results from tests taken at French Hospital in New
   York revealed an inoperable malignant tumor at the base of his skull. In
   his neck, doctors identified a lesion which they diagnosed as
   nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or "lymphoepithelioma", a type of throat
   cancer.^[1] A physician who reviewed Ruth's autopsy in 1998 concluded that
   Ruth's lifelong use of tobacco "probably played a part" in his cancer.^[2]

   Treatments over the next eighteen months proved to be ineffective, with
   Ruth slowly and notably withering.^[3] He was initially treated with
   painful cancer therapies which were available at the time, including X-ray
   therapy. He was also injected with female hormones. He underwent
   unsuccessful surgery to remove the mass. Doctors also tried a new
   treatment called chemotherapy, which made Ruth one of the first cancer
   patients to receive sequential radiation and chemotherapy. He was also
   concurrently given experimental drugs which initially worked, with his
   health temporarily improving. However, the remission proved to be
   temporary.^[4]

   Ruth died in his sleep on August 16, 1948, at 8:01 p.m. in Memorial
   Hospital in New York City; he was 53 years old. Reverend Thomas F.
   Kaufmann gave Ruth the last sacrament, later saying: "The Babe died a
   beautiful death. He said his prayers and lapsed into a sleep. He died in
   his sleep".^[5] Dr. Hayes Martin announced Ruth's death, revealing that
   the cause of death was cancer.^[6] Previously, only his family had known;
   Ruth had not been told of his diagnosis. His body was taken from the
   hospital to the Universal Funeral Chapel and his family allowed mourners
   to visit and pay their respects after 3:00 p.m.^[7]

   In 2008, dentist and associate professor Dr William James Maloney of New
   York University proposed that Ruth died of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. ^[8]

Funeral

   [edit]

   Ruth's funeral took place in New York City, over three days. His body was
   viewed by thousands at Yankee Stadium and St. Patrick's Cathedral. The
   scale of the event was later described in Life magazine: "When the Yankee
   slugger died from cancer at the age of 53, he received the kind of tribute
   normally reserved for kings and presidents. His funeral was a multi-day,
   multi-site affair".^[9]

   [edit]

  Yankee Stadium

   [edit]

   Babe Ruth played for the New York Yankees from 1920 to 1934 and was
   regarded as one of the greatest baseball players.^[12] He starred for them
   for fifteen years.^[13] After his death, thousands of fans were able to
   view Ruth's body as he lay in state at Yankee Stadium.^[14] From August
   17th to the 18th his mahagony casket was placed in the stadium lobby which
   was situated just behind home plate.^[15] In the two days that Ruth was
   displayed in an open casket, it is estimated that 100,000 fans came to
   file past his casket.^[9]

   In 1998, the Montgomery Advertiser said that 77,000 people had jammed the
   streets to wait for their turn to come into Yankee Stadium.^[16] People
   also traveled from other states to pay their respects. After the wake at
   Yankee Stadium, Ruth's body was moved on the night of August 18th and held
   at the Universal Funeral Chapel.^[15]

  St. Patrick's Cathedral

   [edit]

   On August 19, there were 300 police assigned for crowd control at St.
   Patrick's Cathedral where a service for Ruth was to be held.^[15] The
   Brooklyn Daily Eagle ran the headline, "180,000 Brave Rain as Rites Are
   Held for Babe Ruth" on August 19, 1948. There was a service for Ruth at
   St. Patrick's Cathedral and the majority of people could not enter the
   church so they waited outside. The funeral procession arrived at 11 am and
   Ruth was carried into the cathedral in a mahogany casket.^[17] Roughly
   5,000 people were able to enter the cathedral and the police estimated
   that 75,000 were waiting outside. The Messenger newspaper reported that
   the crowd fell silent when Ruth's body was taken from the hearse. Only the
   noise from the policemen's horses walking could be heard, and people
   looked on from rooftops and from the windows of the buildings near the
   church.^[18]^[19] Also attending the funeral were Leo Durocher, manager of
   the Brooklyn Dodgers, Mel Ott, right fielder of the New York Giants, and
   Hank Greenberg, former first baseman and outfielder from the Detroit
   Tigers.^[20]

   At the cathedral, Ruth's casket was placed on a catafalque which was
   surrounded by six lit candles.^[21] The Archbishop of New York, Cardinal
   Francis Spellman delivered the requiem.^[22] Cardinal Spellman did not
   deliver a eulogy but he said a special prayer asking that Ruth's memory
   may inspire future generations.^[21] The text of his speech was reported
   by The Catholic Advance:^[5]

     May the Divine Spirit that inspired Babe Ruth to overcome hardships and
     win the crucial game of life animate many generations of American youth
     to learn to play their positions on all American teams, and may this
     generous-hearted soul, through the mercy of God, the final scoring of
     his own good deeds, and the prayers of his faithful friends, rest in
     everlasting peace. Amen.

  Burial

   [edit]
   [IMG]The graves of Babe and Claire Ruth in Hawthorne, New York

   Ruth's casket, covered with a blanket of roses and orchids, was carried
   from St. Patrick's to the hearse after the mass. The St. Louis
   Globe-Democrat estimated that 75,000 people waited silently outside in the
   rain for the procession to leave. The procession included five flower
   cars, several limousines and the hearse carrying Ruth. The procession went
   through the Bronx, where thousands of people lined the streets to
   watch.^[21]

   The Catholic Advance estimated that 100,000 people lined the streets to
   watch Ruth's funeral procession along the 30 mi (48 km) route.^[5] The
   procession ended at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery where 6,000 people came to
   pay respect and witness Ruth's casket being interred.^[21]

   Shortly after Ruth's death the New York City Council voted to create Babe
   Ruth Plaza near Yankee Stadium.^[23] After his burial, a granite monument
   was placed on top of his gravesite, depicting Jesus Christ blessing a boy
   in a baseball uniform. His wife Claire was later buried alongside him,
   after her death in 1976.^[24] On September 21, 2008, at the sixtieth
   anniversary of Ruth's death, St. Patrick's Cathedral held a memorial mass
   in his honor.^[23]
