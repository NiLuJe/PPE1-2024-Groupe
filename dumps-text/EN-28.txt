   Playing career         1925–1939         

   Charles Albert "Babe" Siebert (January 14, 1904 – August 25, 1939) was a
   Canadian professional ice hockey left winger and defenceman who played 14
   seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Montreal Maroons, New
   York Rangers, Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens. He won the 1926
   Stanley Cup championship with the Maroons, and was a member of the famous
   "S Line", and another with the Rangers in 1933.

   A physical forward known for his fighting ability while with the Maroons
   and Rangers, an apparent decline in his play was reversed when he switched
   to defence after he was traded to the Bruins. Siebert was named an
   all-star three times after the switch and won the Hart Trophy as the NHL's
   most valuable player in 1937 as a member of the Canadiens.

   Siebert was named the head coach of the Canadiens upon his retirement as a
   player in 1939. He never coached a game as he drowned in Lake Huron prior
   to the 1939–40 NHL season. The league organized an all-star benefit game
   that raised $15,000 for Siebert's family. He was inducted into the Hockey
   Hall of Fame in 1964.

Early life

   [edit]

   Born in Plattsville, Ontario, Siebert grew up in the nearby community of
   Zurich, located on the eastern shores of Lake Huron.^[1] He became
   obsessed with hockey at an early age, playing the game nearly every
   day.^[2] He played intermediate hockey in Zurich and Exeter before moving
   to Kitchener to play junior hockey.^[3] Though his elder brothers mocked
   his simple playing style—he used his size and strength to push his way
   through opponents—Siebert was invited to join the Kitchener Greenshirts in
   1922.^[4] He won the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) and eastern Canadian
   junior championships with Kitchener in 1922–23, but lost the Memorial Cup
   final to the University of Manitoba.^[5] After a year of senior hockey in
   Kitchener, he moved on to the Niagara Falls Cataracts, winning the OHA
   senior championship in 1924–25.^[6]

Professional career

   [edit]

   Siebert was signed by the Montreal Maroons in 1925 and made his
   professional debut that same year. He finished second on the team with 16
   goals as the Maroons finished second in the NHL standings.^[1] Montreal
   defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates and Ottawa Senators in the playoffs to win
   the NHL championship.^[7] Siebert scored three points in the 1926 Stanley
   Cup Finals as the Maroons defeated the Western Hockey League champion
   Victoria Cougars to win the Stanley Cup.^[1]

   When Hooley Smith arrived in Montreal in 1926–27, Siebert was paired with
   Smith and Nels Stewart.^[2] The trio were known as the "S Line" and
   emerged as one of the top scoring lines in the NHL.^[7] Stewart was the
   goal scorer on the line while Smith set him up with his passing game, but
   it was Siebert who used his strength and speed to move the puck out of
   their defensive zone and to create space for his line mates.^[2] His
   physical style of play occasionally resulted in Siebert being brought in
   front of league president Frank Calder for supplementary discipline, as in
   December 1927 when he was suspended for a time following a violent melee
   with Billy Boucher of the New York Americans. When Boucher responded to an
   elbow by slashing Siebert over the head, the latter player responded with
   repeated wild swings of his own stick at Boucher, injuring him.^[8]

   Siebert's best offensive season came in 1931–32 when he finished eighth in
   league scoring with 39 points. It proved to be his last season with the
   Maroons, as the team was struggling financially and chose to sell him to
   the New York Rangers for cash.^[1] He went on to win his second Stanley
   Cup that year.^[2] He struggled offensively for much of the season,
   however, and it was rumoured he would be traded.^[9] The trade finally
   happened early in the 1933–34 season as he was sent to the Boston Bruins
   in exchange for Vic Ripley and Roy Burmeister. The deal reunited Siebert
   with former S Line member Nels Stewart.^[10]

   After Eddie Shore was suspended for his assault on Ace Bailey, Bruins
   coach Art Ross shifted Siebert from left wing to defence.^[11] The switch
   rejuvenated his career; he enjoyed a comeback season in 1934–35.
   Frequently remaining on the ice for entire games as one of Boston's key
   players, Siebert earned five votes in a 1935 Associated Press poll naming
   the top comeback player in sport for that year.^[12] He later scoffed at
   the legend of his comeback in Boston, stating that he never lost his
   ability to play at the same level he did with the Maroons, instead blaming
   Lester Patrick for improperly utilizing him in New York.^[11]

   While Shore and Siebert were an effective pairing on defence, tensions
   between the two were evident. They shared a violent feud when they were
   opponents, and never spoke a word to the other as teammates.^[1] Though he
   was named a first team all-star in 1935–36,^[3] the Bruins decided
   Siebert's career was in decline and chose to trade him to the Montreal
   Canadiens along with Roger Jenkins in exchange for Leroy Goldsworthy,
   Sammy McManus and cash following the season.^[1] He was immediately named
   the team's captain, a position he retained until his retirement.^[13] In
   his first season with the Canadiens, Siebert earned his second all-star
   selection and won the Hart Trophy as the most valuable player in the
   NHL.^[14] He earned his third consecutive all-star selection in
   1937–38.^[3] Plagued by injuries in his final season,^[15] Siebert
   announced his retirement in 1939 to become the head coach of the
   Canadiens.^[16]

Death and family

   [edit]

   Siebert never had the opportunity to take up his new post. On August 25,
   1939, while vacationing with his family and swimming with his daughters at
   Lake Huron, he drowned attempting to retrieve an inflatable tire they were
   playing with.^[2] Shocked by the news, Siebert's peers lauded his
   character and play, indicating that his death was a considerable loss to
   the game of hockey. Among them, his former manager with the Maroons, Tommy
   Gorman, remarked that Siebert was popular with his fellow players and was
   a great defenceman who "lost fairly and won modestly".^[17]

   At the time of his death, Siebert was visiting his cottage to celebrate
   the 80th birthday of his father, William. He cherished the time he had
   with his two daughters Judy and Joan, who were 11 and 10 years old
   respectively, when they witnessed his drowning.^[11] His loss represented
   a significant financial burden for his family as he spent nearly all of
   his income paying for his paraplegic wife's medical costs.^[7]

   The league organized an all-star benefit game to aid Siebert's widow with
   the goal of raising $15,000.^[18] It was the third such benefit game in
   NHL history.^[19] The Montreal Canadiens faced an all-star team composed
   of the best players from the remaining teams. The all-stars defeated the
   Canadiens 5–2 in the game held on October 29, 1939.^[1] Though organizers
   were disappointed with the attendance of just 6,000 fans, they met their
   $15,000 target.^[2]

   A physical player and fighter on the ice, Siebert was a soft-spoken family
   man off it.^[4] He was especially faithful to his wife, Bernice, who was
   left a paraplegic following complications during the birth of their second
   child. Fans at the Montreal Forum routinely saw him carry his wife to her
   seat before every home game, and then carry her out after.^[2] At home, he
   did the housework that his wife was unable to do.^[15] As a result, he was
   immensely popular with his peers and fans.^[7]^[15]

   Siebert was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1964,^[7] and is an
   honoured member of the Waterloo Region Hall of Fame.^[20]
