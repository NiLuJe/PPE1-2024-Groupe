        Baby born on migrant boat crossing from Africa to Canary Islands

   A baby was born on a crowded migrant dinghy which travelled from Africa to
   the Canary Islands this week, Spanish coast guards say.

   They have published a picture of the baby boy who was rescued on alongside
   his mother and scores of other migrants.

   The crowded inflatable raft was first spotted on 6 January off the island
   of Lanzarote.

   The rescuers believe they reached the vessel soon after the baby was born
   on the day Spain celebrated the Epiphany, a Christian holiday where
   children traditionally receive gifts.

   The captain of the rescue boat said they knew there was a pregnant woman
   on board, but were surprised to find "a totally naked baby who was born
   10,15 or 20 minutes earlier".

   Domingo Trujillo said when they reached the vessel, the mother was lying
   on the floor of the packed raft while the baby was being held by another
   passenger.

   Spanish authorities published pictures of the rescue on Wednesday

   Upon medical advice, the baby and its mother were taken via helicopter to
   hospital on Lanzarote. No other complications have been reported by
   authorities.

   "It being Three Kings Day, this was the best gift we could have received,"
   the commander of the helicopter, Álvaro Serrano Pérez, told Reuters news
   agency.

   The ocean crossing from Africa to the Canary Islands is notoriously
   dangerous.

   More than 46,800 undocumented migrants made the route last year to reach
   the islands, Spanish government data this month showed.

   The Christian feast day of Epiphany, when observers celebrate the visit to
   Jesus by the Magi - commonly known as the Three Kings, or Wise Men - is
   widely celebrated in Spain.

   Children polish their shoes on the eve of the event known as "El Dia de
   los Reyes" (the Day of the Kings) and leave them ready for the Three Kings
   - Melchior, Caspar and Balthazar - to put their presents in.
