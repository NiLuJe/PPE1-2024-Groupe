                  Positive Parenting Tips: Infants (0–1 years)

Key points

     * As a parent you give your children a good start in life—you nurture,
       protect, and guide them.
     * Learn about developmental milestones, including emotional and social
       development, for babies from birth to one year of age.
     * There are many things you can do to help your baby stay safe and
       healthy.

Developmental milestones

   Skills such as taking a first step, smiling for the first time, and waving
   “bye-bye” are called developmental milestones. Most children achieve these
   milestones by a certain age. Children reach milestones in how they play,
   learn, speak, behave, and move (such as crawling, walking, or jumping).

   In the first year, babies learn to focus their vision, reach out, explore,
   and learn about the things around them. Cognitive, or brain development
   means the learning process of memory, language, thinking, and reasoning.
   Learning language is more than making sounds (babbling) or saying "ma-ma"
   and "da-da." Listening, understanding, and knowing the names of people and
   things are all a part of language development.

   During this stage, babies form bonds of love and trust with their parents
   and others shaping their social and emotional development. The way parents
   cuddle, hold, and play with their baby will set the basis for future
   interactions with them and others.

Positive parenting tips

   Following are some things you, as a parent, can do to help your baby
   during this time:

     * Talk to your baby. They will find your voice calming.
     * Answer when your baby makes sounds by repeating the sounds and adding
       words. This will help them learn to use language.
     * Read to your baby. This will help them develop and understand language
       and sounds.
     * Sing to your baby and play music. This will help your baby develop a
       love for music and will help their brain development.
     * Praise your baby and give them lots of loving attention.
     * Spend time cuddling and holding your baby. This will help them feel
       cared for and secure.
     * Play with your baby when they're alert and relaxed. Watch your baby
       closely for signs of being tired or fussy so that they can take a
       break from playing.
     * Distract your baby with toys and move them to safe areas when they
       start moving and touching things that they shouldn't touch.

  Take care of yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally.‎

   Parenting can be hard work! It is easier to enjoy your new baby and be a
   positive, loving parent when you are feeling good yourself.

Child safety first

   When a baby becomes part of your family it is time to make sure that your
   home is a safe place. Look around your home for things that could be
   dangerous to your baby. Take the necessary steps to make sure that you are
   mentally and emotionally ready for your new baby. Here are a few tips to
   keep your baby safe:

     * Do not shake your baby―ever! Babies have very weak neck muscles that
       can not yet support their heads. If you shake your baby, you can
       damage their brain or even cause their death.
     * Make sure you always put your baby to sleep on their back to prevent
       sudden infant death syndrome (known as SIDS).
     * Protect your baby and family from secondhand smoke. Do not allow
       anyone to smoke in your home.
     * Prevent your baby from choking by cutting their food into small bites.
       Also, don't let them play with small toys and other things that might
       be easy for them to swallow.
     * Don't allow your baby to play with anything that might cover their
       face.
     * Never carry hot liquids or foods near your baby or while holding your
       baby.
     * Vaccines (shots) are important to protect your child's health from
       serious diseases. Talk with your child's doctor to make sure your
       child is up-to-date on their vaccinations.

  Car Seat Recommendations for Children‎

   Place your baby in a rear-facing car seat in the back seat while they are
   riding in a car. This is recommended by the National Highway Traffic
   Safety Administration. Learn more:

   Administration)

Healthy bodies

   Breastfeeding is the natural way to feed your baby. Breast milk meets all
   your baby's needs for about the first 6 months of life. Between 6 and 12
   months of age, your baby will learn about new tastes and textures with
   healthy solid food. However, breast milk should still remain an important
   source of nutrition.

     * Feed your baby slowly and patiently, encourage them to try new tastes
       but without force, and watch closely to see if they're still hungry.
     * Keep your baby active. They might not be able to run and play like the
       "big kids" just yet, but there's lots they can do to keep their little
       arms and legs moving throughout the day.
     * Getting down on the floor to move helps your baby become strong,
       learn, and explore.
     * Try not to keep your baby in swings, strollers, bouncer seats, and
       exercise saucers for too long.
     * Limit screen time. For children under 18 months of age, the American
       Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies do not use any
       screen media other than video chatting.
     * Make sure your child gets the recommended amount of sleep each night:
       For infants 4–12 months of age, 12–16 hours per 24 hours (including
       naps).

  Challenges with Breastfeeding‎

   If you need help, you can call the National Breastfeeding Helpline at
   800-994-9662. You can also call your local WIC Program to see if you
   qualify for breastfeeding support by health professionals, or find an
   International Board-Certified Lactation Consultant in your community.
