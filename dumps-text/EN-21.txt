   Babe (Serbian Cyrillic: Бабе; translation: Grandmas) is a Serbian rock
   band.

   Babe were formed in 1992 as a supergroup, with Bajaga i Instruktori
   guitarist Žika Milenković on vocals and guitar, Električni Orgazam drummer
   Goran Čavajda "Čavke" on drums and vocals, Riblja Čorba guitarist Zoran
   Ilić, and former Bezobrazno Zeleno bassist Bojan Vasić. They got together
   with the intention of recording a studio album of quirky material they
   weren't able to develop and push through their original bands. Vasić left
   during the recording sessions and was replaced by Dejan Škopelja (formerly
   of U Škripcu). Initially a side project, Babe gained a large popularity
   with their 1993 release Slike iz života jednog idiota, with hits like "Noć
   bez sna" and "Da te vidim golu" that led to the band continuing on.

   However, their second album, despite the hit song "Ko me ter'o", did not
   see the same success. Čavajda left the band after the album release, and
   the band released another studio album before ending their activity in
   1999. Babe reunited in 2013, in the lineup featuring Milenković, Ilić,
   Škopelja and drummer Goran Ljuboja "Trut".

History

   [edit]

  Formation and commercial success (1992–1995)

   [edit]
   [IMG]The founding members of Babe: Žika Milenković (left) and Goran
   Čavajda "Čavke" (right)

   The band was formed in 1992 as a side project of Bajaga i Instruktori
   member Žika Milenković (vocals, guitar), Električni Orgazam member Goran
   Čavajda "Čavke" (vocals, drums) and Riblja Čorba member Zoran Ilić
   (guitar). All three being rock veterans, they decided to steadily work
   within the group during the times when their own bands were taking a work
   break.^[1] The band's bass guitarist and the initiator of the band
   formation was Bojan Vasić, who had previously played with Ilić in
   Bezobrazno Zeleno.^[1] Humorous lyrics written by Milenković, a graduate
   from Belgrade Faculty of Applied Arts,^[2] stylistically similar to the
   lyrical style of his early 1980s band Mačori (The Cats), and his stage
   performance, based on the experience gained in the long-term activities
   within the Teatar Levo (Theatre Left) amateur theatre, soon became the
   band's trademark.^[1]

   During the recording sessions for the band's debut album, Vasić left the
   band, moving to South Africa,^[1] eventually only recording the bass
   sections for the song "Mirko i Marina" ("Mirko and Marina").^[1] He was
   replaced by a former U Škripcu member Dejan Škopelja.^[1] Slike iz života
   jednog idota (Images From an Idiot's Life), released in 1993 and produced
   by former Električni Orgazam member Ljubomir Jovanović "Jovec",^[1]
   brought Milenković's humorous songs about drunks, drug dealers and
   erotomaniacs, which had large success, especially with young audience.^[1]
   The album featured guest appearances by vocalist Marija Mihajlović,
   Ekatarina Velika keyboardist Margita Stefanović, Riblja Čorba guitarist
   Vidoja Božinović, Električni Orgazam guitarist Branislav Petrović
   "Banana", Bajaga i Instruktori guitarist Nenad Stamatović, keyboardist
   Miša Savić and Del Arno Band members.^[1] After the album release, Babe
   went on a promotional tour, performing as an opening act for Riblja
   Čorba.^[1]

   In January 1994 the band performed at the unplugged festival held at the
   Belgrade Sava Centar, and the recording of the song "Adio stres" ("Adio
   Stress"), featuring guest appearances by keyboardist Margita Stefanović
   and Del Arno Band percussionist Vladimir Lešić, was released on the
   various artists live compilation Bez struje (Unplugged), released by MTS
   Records.^[3] On February 17 of the same year, the band performed at the
   Belgrade Youth Center and the recording of the cover version of the Azra
   song "Lijepe žene prolaze kroz grad" ("Pretty Women are Passing Through
   the Town"), made at the performance, appeared on the various artists live
   compilation album Groovanje live vol. 1 (Rumbling Live Vol. 1), released
   by L.V.O Records in 1995.^[4] On April 30, 1994 the band performed at the
   Rock and roll zauvek (Rock and Roll Forever) rock spectacle, held at the
   Belgrade Fair – Hall 1 in order to celebrate thirty years of rock music in
   Yugoslavia.

   In December of the same year, not long before New Year's Day, the band
   released a compact cassette EP 4 Babe pesme (4 Babe Songs), featuring the
   songs "Novogodišnja pesma" ("New Year's Day Song"), "Loša navika" ("Bad
   Habit"), "Reći ćemo hvala kad bude karnevala" ("We Will Thank Only If
   There Will Be a Carnival") and "Dizel" ("Diesel"), the latter being a
   cover version of Tommy Roe's song "Dizzy".^[1] At the time, Milenković
   starred the Elvira je cool (Elvira is Cool) theatre play, also starring
   Lora Orlović and Neda Arnerić, written by the Aleksandar Žikić and
   performed at the Dušan Radović Theatre in Belgrade.^[1] Also, the band had
   appeared in the Srđan Dragojević film Two Hours of Quality TV Program,
   performing the song "Dizel".^[5] The following year appeared the
   soundtrack album for the Marija Soldatović play Zigi, Zvezdana Prašina
   (Ziggy Stardust), staged at the Bitef Theatre, consisting of cover
   versions of the David Bowie greatest hits, with Milenković and Čavajda
   working on the song lyrics translations and the latter providing lead
   vocals for the cover versions of "Five Years" and "Rock 'n' Roll
   Suicide".^[6]

  Decline, Čavajda's death and breakup (1995–1999)

   [edit]

   In late 1995 the band released their second studio album, Lažne slike o
   ljubavi (False Images of Love), but the album did not reach the success of
   the debut, although the songs "Ko me ter'o" ("Who's Made Me") and
   "Mesnica" ("Butcher Shop") became minor hits, having a decent media
   coverage.^[1] The rest of the album remained unnoticed, including the
   cover version of "Strangers in the Night", with lyrics in Serbian entitled
   "Stranac usranac" ("Stranger in the Shit").^[1] After the album release,
   Čavajda left the band, being replaced by Vlada Cvetković.^[1] Čavajda
   later starred the film Geto (Ghetto), directed by Ivan Markov and Mladen
   Matičević,^[1] before moving to Tasmania where he died of AIDS on February
   16, 1997 at the age of 35.^[1]

   In early 1998 the band released the compilation album P.S Babe, composed
   of the material previously released on the debut album and the 4 Babe
   pesme EP as well as new material, consisting of the songs "Hoću da budem
   predsednik Srbije" ("I Want To Be The President of Serbia"), "Zadnja noć"
   ("The Last Night") and "Mladi ludi svet" ("Young Crazy World").^[1] At the
   time, the band started preparing the material for the third studio album,
   with Milenković seeking inspiration for song lyrics in the works of
   Momčilo Bajagić, Aleksandar Žikić (of the band S.T.R.A.H.), Danko Đurić
   (of the band Papatra), Zoran Ćirić's book Vulvaši (Vulvas) and street
   graffiti.^[1] Slike sna i jave (Samo za ludake i buntovnike) (Images of
   Dream and Reality (For Lunatics and Rebels Only)) featuring new members,
   Vladan Nedeljkov (guitar) and Blagoje Nedeljković (drums), was released in
   1999.^[1] The material, consisting of sixteen songs, featured the songs
   "Mexico", written in 1982 during Milenković's work with the band Mačori,
   and "U sukobu 2 pola" ("In the Two Gender Clash"), a cover of Hazel
   O'Connor's song "Will You?".^[1]

   After the album release, Milenković's main band Bajaga i Instruktori
   started the recording sessions for the album Zmaj od Noćaja (The Dragon of
   Noćaj), due to which Babe band ceased to exist, even though it had never
   been officially announced.^[1] During 2000, the song "Hoću da budem P.S."
   ("I want to be P.S.") appeared on the Gotov je! (He is Done!) various
   artists compilation, which featured protest songs.^[7]

  Reunion (2013–present)

   [edit]

   In 2013, Babe reunited in the lineup featuring, beside Milenković, Ilić
   and Škopelja, the drummer Goran Ljuboja "Trut" (of E-Play and formerly of
   Rambo Amadeus backing band), with guitarist Stefan Aćimović and Dejan
   Škopelja's daughter, keyboardist Luna Škopelja soon being added to the
   lineup.^[8] The reunited Babe had their first performance at the Long
   Night festival, held in Belgrade Youth Center on March 30.^[9]

   In July 2014, the band released their comeback single, "Daj mu ga, Lola"
   ("Come On, Lola"), originally written in 2001.^[10] In the following
   period the band performed on a number of major festivals, including
   Arsenal Fest^[11] and Belgrade Beer Fest.^[12] In March 2017, the band
   released the single "Primabalerina".^[13] In October 2019, the band
   released the EP Volim život (I Love Life), featuring four new songs,
   available for free digital download.^[14]

Legacy

   [edit]
