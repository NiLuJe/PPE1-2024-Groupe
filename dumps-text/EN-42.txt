   The NCAA women’s basketball landscape has looked a lot more appealing in
   the past season. Thanks to the outstanding collegiate career of Caitlin

   Just like any ‘casual’ sports fan who’s been forced to watch sports for
   the love of their partner, apart from talent, the appearance of players
   could be a determining factor in who they pay attention to on the field of
   play. This is no different in the NCAA Women’s basketball. While all the
   attention will be on Paige Bueckers of UConn, JuJu Watkins of USC, there
   will be a few spectators who are looking for their next muse. Don’t worry
   we got you!
