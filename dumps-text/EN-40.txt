Plot synopsis

   [edit]

   Sarah Ouseph (Neena Gupta), is suffering from hallucinations probably
   related to her career as an obstetric head nurse in the past. She's living
   with her son, Bibin Ouseph (Sanju Sivram) in Mundakkayam after retirement.
   Sarah is very controlling and Bibin is apparently okay with that. Bibin
   works as a lab technician in a nearby lab and caters to all the needs of
   Sarah.

   On a fateful day, Sarah reveals some disturbing secrets related to her
   past to Bibin, and struggling to deal with how Sarah changed his destiny,
   Bibin attacks Sarah and flees with Sarah's diaries. Sarah is admitted to a
   hospital and requests of the doctor to arrange a meeting with a local CI
   and a legal advisor. She hands over 2 letters to them, one for the police
   and one for the magistrate (Joy Mathew). Soon after, Sarah dies while the
   police decide not to pursue the crimes done by Sarah as there is no way to
   deal with the social situation if her secrets are out in public.

   However, the truth overwhelms Bibin and he chooses to go and learn more
   about his original parents. As soon as he learns the child that was
   swapped with him was treating her parents badly, he decides to make her go
   away and deviously concocts a plan that leads to her death.

   Having all the information of the babies his foster mother swapped, he
   goes through one by one with the help of like-minded others who share his
   ideology, with the intention of removing individuals from the face of the
   planet, especially those who did not live up to the opportunities they
   got. However, he also starts sending a series of cryptic letters to a
   friend of his which catches the attention of the Kerala police, and they
   are on his case, led by Aji Kurien (Rahman).
