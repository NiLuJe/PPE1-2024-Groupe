Spanish

of
the

who
was
rescued
on
alongside
his

and
scores

The

soon
after

on
the
day
Spain

the
Epiphany
a

The

said
they

there

woman
on
board

were
surprised
to
find
a
totally

who
was
born

Domingo

said
when
they
reached

the
mother
was

might
be
enough
until
your
baby
becomes
more
mobile

Bathing
your
baby
too
much
can
dry
out
your
baby
s
skin

If
you
re
quick
and
thorough
with
diaper
changes
and
burp
cloths
you
re
already
cleaning
the
parts
that
need
attention
the
face
neck
and
diaper
area

Between
baths
you
may
also
check
the
folds
of
your
baby
s
skin
including
thighs
groin
armpits
and
chin

If
needed
clean
these
areas
with
a
wet
washcloth

Is
it
better
to
bathe
my
baby
in
the
morning
or
at
night

That
s
up
to
you

Choose
a
time
when
you
re
not
rushed
or
likely
to
be
interrupted

Some
parents
opt
for
morning
baths
when
their
babies
are
alert

Others
prefer
to
make
baby
baths
part
of
a
calming
bedtime
ritual

If
you
bathe
your
baby
after
a
feeding
consider
waiting
for
your
baby
s
tummy
to
settle
a
bit
first

The
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
recommends
sponge
baths
until
the
umbilical
cord
stump
falls
off
which
might
take
a
week
or
two

To
give
your
baby
a
sponge
bath
you
ll
need
A
warm
place
with
a
flat
surface

A
bathroom
or
kitchen
counter
changing
table
or
firm
bed
will
work

Even
a
blanket
or
towel
on
the
floor
is
OK

Pad
hard
surfaces
with
a
blanket
or
towel

A
soft
blanket
towel
or
changing
pad

Spread
it
out
for
your
baby
to
lie
on

A
free
hand

Always
keep
one
hand
on
your
baby

On
a
changing
table
use
the
safety
strap
as
well

A
sink
or
shallow
basin
to
hold
the
water

Run
warm
water
into
the
it
s
not
too
hot

Essential
supplies

Gather
a
washcloth
a
towel
preferably
with
a
built-in
hood
fragrance-free
baby
shampoo
and
soap
baby
wipes
a
clean
diaper
and
a
change
of
clothes

Undress
your
baby
and
wrap
him
or
her
in
a
towel

Lay
your
baby
on
his
or
her
back
in
the
prepared
area

To
keep
your
baby
warm
only
expose
the
parts
of
your
baby
s
body
that
you
re
washing

Wet
the
washcloth
with
plain
warm
water

Then
wring
out
excess
water
and
wipe
your
baby
s
face

Wipe
each
eyelid
from
the
inside
to
the
outside
corner

To
clean
your
baby
s
body
use
a
dampened
washcloth
dipped
in
plain
or
soapy
water

If
you
use
soap
make
sure
it
s
mild
and
moisturizing

Pay
special
attention
to
creases
under
the
arms
behind
the
ears
around
the
neck
and
in
the
diaper
area

Also
wash
between
your
baby
s
fingers
and
toes

What
type
of
baby
tub
is
best

Once
your
baby
is
ready
for
a
bath
you
might
use
a
plastic
tub
or
the
sink

Line
the
tub
or
sink
with
a
clean
towel

Gather
the
supplies
you
d
use
for
a
sponge
bath
a
cup
of
rinsing
water
and
baby
shampoo
if
needed
ahead
of
time

This
will
allow
you
to
keep
one
hand
on
the
baby
at
all
times

Never
leave
your
baby
alone
in
the
water

How
much
water
should
I
put
in
the
tub

A
common
recommendation
is
inches
about
centimeters
During
bath
time
always
be
sure
to
give
your
baby
undivided
attention
and
hold
your
baby
securely

If
you
forget
something
you
need
for
the
bath
take
your
baby
with
you

Never
leave
your
baby
alone
in
the
tub
even
for
an
instant

What
about
water
temperature

Warm
water
is
best

To
prevent
scalding
set
the
thermostat
on
your
water
heater
to
below
F
C
Always
check
the
water
temperature
with
your
hand
before
bathing
your
baby

Aim
for
bath
water
around
F
C
Be
sure
the
room
is
comfortably
warm
too

A
wet
baby
can
be
easily
chilled

What
s
the
best
way
to
hold
my
newborn
in
the
tub

A
secure
hold
will
help
your
baby
feel
comfortable
and
stay
safe
in
the
tub

Use
your
nondominant
arm
to
support
your
baby
s
head
and
neck
and
the
other
to
hold
and
guide
your
baby
s
body
into
the
water
feet
first

Continue
supporting
your
baby
s
head
and
back
as
needed

You
might
reach
behind
your
baby
and
hold
on
to
his
or
her
opposite
arm
throughout
the
bath

What
should
I
wash
first

Most
parents
start
with
the
baby
s
head
and
face
and
move
down
to
dirtier
parts
of
the
body

This
keeps
rinsed
areas
from
getting
soapy
again

If
your
newborn
has
hair
and
you
think
it
needs
washing
go
ahead

With
your
free
hand
gently
massage
a
drop
of
mild
baby
shampoo
into
your
baby
s
scalp

Rinse
the
shampoo
with
a
cup
of
water
or
a
damp
washcloth
cupping
one
hand
across
your
baby
s
forehead
to
keep
suds
out
of
his
or
her
eyes

Will
lotion
after
a
baby
bath
help
prevent
rashes

Most
newborns
don
t
need
lotion
after
a
bath

If
your
baby
s
skin
is
very
dry
apply
a
small
amount
of
unscented
baby
moisturizer
to
the
dry
areas

The
massage
might
make
your
baby
feel
good

If
dryness
continues
you
might
be
bathing
your
baby
too
often

development

Try
these
simple
tips
and
activities
in
a
safe
way

Talk
with
your
baby
s
doctor
and
teachers
if
you
have
questions
or
for
more
ideas
on
how
to
help
your
baby
s
development

Repeat
your
baby
s
sounds
and
say
simple
words
using
those
sounds

For
example
if
your
baby
says
bababa
repeat
bababa
then
say
book

Place
toys
on
the
ground
or
on
a
play
mat
a
little
out
of
reach
and
encourage
your
baby
to
crawl
scoot
or
roll
to
get
them

Celebrate
when

reaches
them

Teach

wave
bye-bye
or
shake
his
head
no

For

Parenting
Tips

Play
games
such
as
peek-a-boo

You
can
cover
your
head
with
a
cloth
and
see
if
your
baby
pulls
it
off

Play
with
your
baby
by
dumping
blocks
from
a
container
and
putting
them
back
in
together

Play
games
with
your
baby
such
as
my
turn
your
turn

Try
this
by
passing
a
toy
back
and
forth

Read
to
your
baby

Reading
can
be
talking
about
pictures

For
example
while
looking
at
books
or
magazines
name
the
pictures
as
you
point
to
them

Limit
screen
time
TV
tablets
phones
etc

to
video
calling
with
loved
ones

Screen
time
is
not
recommended
for
children
younger
than
years
of
age

Babies
learn
by
talking
playing
and
interacting
with
others

Find
out
about
choking
risks
and
safe
foods
to
feed
your
baby

Let
him
practice
feeding
himself
with
his
fingers
and
using
a
cup
with
a
small
amount
of
water

Sit
next
to
your
baby
and
enjoy
mealtime
together

Expect
spills

Learning
is
messy
and
fun

Ask
for
behaviors
that
you
want

For
example
instead
of
saying
don
t
stand
say
time
to
sit

Help
your
baby
get
used
to
foods
with
different
tastes
and
textures

Foods
can
be
smooth
mashed
or
finely
chopped

Your
baby
might
not
like
every
food
on
the
first
try

Give
her
a
chance
to
try
foods
again
and
again

Say
a
quick
and
cheerful
goodbye
instead
of
sneaking
away
so
your
baby
knows
you
are
leaving
even
if
he
cries

He
will
learn
to
calm
himself
and
what
to
expect

Let
him
know
when
you
return
by
saying
Daddy
s
back

Have
routines
for
sleeping
and
feeding

Babies
do
better
when
they
know
what
to
expect

Stay
close
by
as
your
baby
explores
and
moves
around
your
home
so
she
knows
that
you
are
near

Make
sure
your
baby
gets
enough
sleep
to
-month-olds
need
to
hours
of
sleep
a
day
including
naps
Consistent
sleep
times
make
it
easier

Take
care
of
yourself

Parenting
can
be
hard
work

It
is
easier
to
enjoy
your
growing
baby
and
be
a
loving
parent
when
you
feel
good
yourself

Make
it
a
game
when
your
baby
drops
things

Hand
the
item
back
to
her
so
she
can
drop
it
again

Pay
attention
to
the
way
he
reacts
to
new
situations
and
people
try
to
continue
to
do
things
that
make
your
baby
happy
and
comfortable

Describe
what
your
baby
is
looking
at
for
example
red
round
ball

Play
a
game
that
teaches
your
baby
to
look
for
things
she
sees
you
hide
such
as
a
toy
under
a
blanket

Give
your
baby
safe
places
to
explore

Baby-proof
your
home

For
example
move
sharp
or
breakable
things

For

Taking
a
baby
on
a
plane
is
something
that
most
parents
approach
with
caution

Infants
and
air
travel
can
both
be
unpredictable
and
they
don
t
always
mix
well

But
some
advanced
planning
and
preparation
can
help
make
for
a
better
experience
for
your
baby
for
you
and
for
everyone
else
on
the
plane

infant
along
with
tips
for
a
smoother
and
safer
flight

When
is
my
baby
old
enough
to
fly
on
an
airplane

Generally
you
should
avoid
flying
with
your
newborn
until
they
are
at
least
days
old

Ideally
wait
until
your
baby
is
two
or
three
months
old
to
fly

Air
travel
and
being
in
crowded
airports
can
increase
a
newborn
s
risk
of
catching
an
infectious
disease

Should
my
baby
sit
on
my
lap
during
the
flight

Ideally
no

The
Federal
Aviation
Administration
FAA
doesn
t
require
a
ticket
for
children
under
the
age
of
years

But
that
means
your
baby
will
be
on
your
lap

If
there
is
turbulence
or
worse
it
may
not
be
physically
possible
to
protect
your
baby
in
your
arms

Turbulence
is
the
number
one
cause
of
children
s
injuries
on
an
airplane

If
you
do
not
buy
a
ticket
for
your
child
you
may
want
to
ask
if
your
airline
will
let
you
use
an
empty
seat
where
you
can
install
a
car
seat
for
your
baby

If
your
airline
s
lap
baby
policy
allows
this
avoid
the
busiest
travel
days
and
times
to
increase
your
odds
of
finding
an
empty
seat
next
to
you

The
safest
way
for
baby
to
fly
The
safest
way
for
your
baby
to
fly
is
in
a
child
safety
restraint
an
FAA-approved
car
seat
or
airplane
harness
device

It
should
be
approved
for
your
child
s
age
and
size
and
installed
with
the
airplane
s
seat
cases
they
can
be
checked
at
the
gate
where
the
risk
of
damage
may
be
lower
at
no
cost

Consider
packing
the
car
seat
in
a
protective
bag
or
box

If
your
baby
has
their
own
airplane
seat
bring
your
car
seat
with
you

use
in
motor
vehicles
and
aircraft

Which
seat
on
the
plane
is
best
for
a
baby

Look
for
rows
on
the
plane
with
more
space
like
the
bulkhead

Exit
Choose
a
seat
closer
to
the
window
if
possible

Aisle
seats
can
be
risky
for
babies
during
beverage
service

Hot
drinks
being
passed
to
passengers
can
spill
and
cause
burns
and
their
little
arms
and
legs
can
be
caught
by
passing
carts

Aisle
seats
are
also
closer
to
falling
they
be
installed
in
a
window
seat

Ensure
that
your
baby
s
seat
is
next
to
you
on
the
plane

Visit
the
U
S
Department
of
Transportation

Dashboard
for

It
shows
which
airlines

adjacent
seats
for

an
adult
at
no
extra
fee

Is
there
a
way
my
baby
can
lie
down
flat
on
long
flights

Buckling
your
baby
into
a
car
seat
or
safety
restraint
remains
the
safest
option

However
there
are
other
options
available
to
help
baby
sleep
comfortably
especially
on
long-haul
flights

another
cabin

In
some
premium
cabins
they
can
be
built
into
the
seat
compartment
to
use
in
bulkhead
rows

Most
airline
bassinets
require
the
baby
to
be
under
months
old
and
or
pounds
and
not
yet
able
to
sit
up
unassisted

These
bassinets
are
sometimes
called
skycots
or
baskets

Inflatable
seat
extenders

Some
airlines
let
you
bring
your
own
inflatable
individual
seat
extension
for
your
baby
to
snooze
on
lying
down

Not
all
airlines
permit
these
to
be
used
though
so
check
ahead
of
time

Your
child
will
need
their
own
seat
to
use
one

Note
For
all
options
above
your
baby
would
still
need
to
be
buckled
into
a
car
seat
or
held
on
your
lap
during
takeoff
turbulence
and
landing

Safe
sleep
practices
still
apply
on
the
airplane

If
your
baby
sleeps
on
your
lap
during
the
flight
stay
alert
and
check
on
your
baby
often

Make
sure
they
can
breathe
easily
and
their
face
is
uncovered

If
your
baby
sleeps
on
another
device
during
the
flight
check
that
it
is
firm
and
flat
with
no
soft
bedding

Any
tips
for
keeping

comfortable
and
content
on
the

Dress
your
baby
in
layers

The
temperature
in
a
plane
can
vary
widely
especially
if
you
are
stuck
waiting
on
a
runway

So
dress
your
baby
in
layers
of
clothing

As
you
pick
out
clothing
choose
outfits
that
make
diaper
changing
in
a
small
space
easier

Also
pack
a
change
of
Be

for
ear
pain
during
take-off
and
landing

During
takeoff
and
landing
changes
in
pressure
between
the
outer
ear
and
middle
ear
can
cause
discomfort

If
your
baby
has
had
ear
surgery
or
an
ear
infection
in
the
past
two
weeks
ask
their
doctor
if
it
s
OK
to
fly

Having
babies
drink
from
the
breast
or
a
bottle
or
suck
on
a
pacifier
can
help

If
your
child
has
a
cold
or
ear
infection
a
dose
of
acetaminophen
or
ibuprofen
may
help
check
with
your
doctor
for
the
decibels
and
is
even
louder
during
takeoff

Using
cotton
balls
small
earplugs
or
noise-canceling
headphones
may
help
to
decrease
the
decibel
level
your
baby
is
exposed
to
and
also
make
it
easier
for
them
to
sleep
or
relax

Keep
in
mind
that
sleeping
babies
are
easier
for
everyone

If
possible
travel
at
a
time
when
your
baby
naturally
sleeps

Or
onsider
trying
to
put
off
a
nap
until
it
s
time
to
fly

Flight
delays
can
cause
this
to
backfire
if
your
exhausted
baby
decides
to
scream
instead
of
sleep

But
it
may
be
worth
a
try

Do
not
use
diphenhydramine
or
Benadryl
to
help
your
baby
sleep
without
talking
to
your
doctor

medicine
by
getting
more
awake
instead
of
sleepy

Consider
a
diaper
change
right
before
boarding
the
plane

A
dry
baby
is
a
happy
baby

Fortunately
when
you
do
need
to
change
a
diaper
in-flight
many
planes
have
restroom
changing
tables

If
yours
doesn
t
ask
a
flight
attendant
if
there
is
a
spot
where
you
can
spread
out
your
changing
pad

Some
parents
resort
to
diaper-changing
on
the
closed
toilet
seat

If
you
try
this
be
sure
to
have
a
hand
on
your
baby
at
all
times
and
pack
a
disposable
changing
pad

Plan
for
delays
pack
plenty
of
supplies

Bring
distractions

Pack
some
toys
and
books
and
be
ready
to
play
with
your
baby
the
entire
time

A
tablet
with
videos
can
be
a
good
backup
if
the
toys
and
books
aren
t
helping
anymore
we
don
t
encourage
entertainment
media
for
children
under
the
age
of
but
desperate
Don
t
let
the
glares
get
to
you

Despite
the
best
advanced
planning
and
efforts
babies
cry
sometimes

Know
that
you
did
and
are
doing
all
you
can

At
that
point
one
of
the
best
ways
you
can
calm
your
baby
may
be
to
stay
calm
yourself

And
remember
that
for
every
person
who
is
glaring
at
you
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
have
been
through
it
themselves
and
have
lots
of
sympathy

Ask
for
help

Arrange
for
your
airline
to
help
you
if
you
need
help
making
a
connecting
flight

Carrying
a
child
safety
restraint
your
baby
and
luggage
through
a
busy
airport
can
be
challenging

Does
my
baby
need
a
passport
for
international
travel

Yes

All
U
S
citizens
including
infants
need
a
current
passport
to
travel
internationally

Parents
or
guardians
need
to
apply
with
their
baby
in
person
using
the
form
DS-

Be
sure
to
bring
your
baby
s
birth
certificate
and
a
photo
taken
within
the
last
months

Passport
photos
must
be
taken
with
nobody
else
in
the
photo
which
can
be
tricky
with
infants

To
do
this
safely
if
your
baby
can
t
sit
up
yet
lay
them
on
their
back
on
a
plain
white
blanket
or
sheet
to
ensure
head
support
without
having
to
hold
them

Another
option
is
covering
a
car
seat
What
about
domestic
flights

A
valid
passport
is
usually
the
only
identification
your
baby
will
need
to
fly
on
a
domestic
flight
unless
you
need
to
show
proof
of
age
for
a
discounted
child
fare

Check
with
your
airline
before
you
leave

Note
Children
under
age
will
not
be
required
to
get
a
Real
ID

What
is
the
best
time
of
day
to
fly
with
a
baby

It
is
hard
to
say
whether
flying
during
the
day
or
night
with
a
baby
is
better

After
the
first
few
weeks
some
infants
may
sleep
more
reliably
at
nighttime
than
they
do
during
naptime
travel

If
you
and
your
baby
can
sleep
on
the
plane
a
late-night
flight
may
be
the
way
to
go

at
a

orphaned
pig
Babe
is
brought
home
to
the
farm
of
the
contest
winner
Arthur
Hoggett

There
he
is
taken
in
by
Border
Collie
Fly
her
irascible
mate
Rex
and
their
puppies
and
befriends
a
duck
named
Ferdinand
who
wakes
useful
and
be
spared
from
being
eaten

Dismayed
when
the
Hoggetts
buy
an
alarm
clock
Ferdinand
persuades
Babe
to
help
him
get
rid
of
it

In
doing
so
they
wake
Duchess
the
Hoggetts
cat
and
wreck
the
house
in
the
ensuing
chaos

Rex
sternly
instructs
Babe
to
stay
away
from
Ferdinand
and
the
house

Seeing
Fly
saddened
when
her
puppies
are
put
up
for
sale
Babe
lets
her
adopt
him

With
the
Hoggett
s
relatives
visiting
for
Christmas
Hoggett
decides
against
choosing
Babe
for
Christmas
dinner
and
tells
his
wife
Esme
that
Babe
may
bring
a
prize
for
ham
at
the
next
county
fair

Ferdinand
s
love
interest
Rosanna
is
served
instead
prompting
Ferdinand
to
escape
the
farm

Babe
investigates
the
fields
where
he
witnesses
a
pair
of
sheep
rustlers
stealing
Hoggett
s
sheep
and
quickly
alerts
Fly
and
the
farmer
preventing
the
rustlers
from
taking
the
whole
flock

Impressed
after
seeing
Babe
sort
hens
separating
the
brown
from
the
white
ones
Hoggett
takes
him
to
try
and
herd
the
sheep

Encouraged
by
an
elderly
ewe
named
Maa
Babe
gets
the
sheep
to
cooperate
by
asking
nicely
but
Rex
perceives
Babe
s
actions
as
an
insult
to
sheepdogs

When
Fly
stands
up
for
Babe
Rex
attacks
and
injures
her
and
bites
Hoggett
s
hand
when
he
tries
to
intervene

Rex
is
subsequently
chained
to
the
dog
house
and
sedated
leaving
the
sheep
herding
job
to
Babe

One
morning
Babe
scares
off
a
trio
of
feral
dogs
attacking
the
sheep
but
Maa
is
mortally
injured
and
dies
as
a
result

Hoggett
thinking
Babe
was
responsible
prepares
to
shoot
him
but
Fly
finds
out
the
truth
from
the
other
sheep
and
distracts
Hoggett
long
enough
for
Esme
to
inform
him
about
the
dogs
attacks
on
neighboring
farms

When
Esme
leaves
on
a
trip
Hoggett
signs
Babe
up
for
a
local
sheep
herding
competition

As
it
is
raining
the
night
before
Hoggett
lets
him
and
Fly
into
the
house
where
he
is
scratched
by
Duchess
who
in
turn
is
temporarily
confined
outside
as
punishment

When
she
is
let
back
in
later
she
gets
revenge
on
Babe
by
revealing
that
humans
consume
pigs

After
learning
from
Fly
that
this
is
true
Babe
runs
away
and
Rex
finds
him
the
next
morning
in
a
cemetery

Hoggett
brings
a
demoralized
Babe
home
where
he
refuses
to
eat

Hoggett
feeds
him
from
a
baby
bottle
sings

At
the
competition
Babe
meets
the
sheep
that
he
will
be
herding
but
they
ignore
his
attempts
to
speak
to
them

As
Hoggett
is
criticized
by
the
bemused
judges
and
ridiculed
by
the
public
for
using
a
pig
instead
of
a
dog
Rex
runs
back

the
farm
to
ask
the
sheep
what
to
do

After
promising
he
will
treat
them
better
from
now
on
the
sheep
disclose
to
him
a
secret
password

He
returns
in
time
to
convey
the
password
to
Babe
and
the
sheep
now
follow
his
instructions
flawlessly

Amid
the
crowd
s
acclamation
Babe
is
unanimously
given
a
perfect
score

When
Babe
sits
down

Hoggett

Babe
is
an
adaptation
of
Dick
King-Smith
s
novel
The
Sheep-Pig
also
known
as
Babe
The
Gallant
Pig
in
the
US
which
tells
the
story
of
a
pig
raised
as
livestock
who
wants
to
do
the
work
of
a
sheepdog

The
main
animal
characters
are
played
by
a
combination
of
real
and
animatronic
pigs
from
the
adults

After
seven
years
of
development
Babe
was
filmed
in
Robertson
New

producer
George
Miller
and
director
Chris
Noonan

Noonan
later
complained
I
don
t
want
to
make
a
lifelong
enemy
of
George
Miller
but
I
thought
that
he
tried
to
take
credit
for
Babe
tried
to
exclude
me
from
any
credit
and
it
made
me
very
insecure

It
was
like
your
guru
has
told
you
that
you
are
no
good
and
that
is
really
disconcerting

his
name
off
the
credits
on
internet
sites
which
is
just
absolutely
untrue

You
know
I
m
sorry
but
I
really
have
a
lot
more
to
do
with
my
life
than
worry
about
that

when
it
comes
to
Babe
the
vision
was
handed
to
Chris
on

didn
t
have

In

by

Babe
Pig
in

was
released
but
it
failed
to
achieve

as

Kate
Upton
Is
a
Total
Babe
in
This
New
Video
She
s
known
for
hiding
references
to
her
personal
life
in
her
work
but
in
the
case
of
her
latest
song
there
are
more
questions
than
answers

The
biggest
being
Who
is
Taylor
Swift
s
new
song
Babe
about

On
Friday
the
artist
released
the
new
track
with
Sugarland
which
heavily
hints
at
cheating

Although
new
isn
t
exactly
the
right
word
for
it

Because
of
to
listeners
to
decide
for
themselves
who
she
s
talking
about
with
lyrics
like
Since
you
admitted
it
I
keep
picturing
her
lips
on
your
neck
I
can
t
unsee
it
I
hate
that
because
of
you
I
can
t
love
you
babe

So
get
out
your
big
magnifying
glass
like
the
pop-culture
detective
that
you
are
and
crack
this
case

Babe
was
written
by
Swift
and
Patrick
Monahan
of
Train
and
the
Reputation
singer
is
featured
in
the
chorus
but
the
country
duo
wasn
t
the
track
s
first
stop

ET
Canada
reported
that
Swift
and
Monahan
initially
created
the
collaboration
for
the
singer
s
fourth
album
Red
but
that
it
didn
t
end
up
making
the
cut

And
since
Red
came
out
in
October
that
helps
place
Babe
in
time

The
singer
had
released
Speak
Now
two
years
prior
so
that
gives
a
small
window
between
the
end
of
and
probably
mid-
in
which
she
was
likely
writing
songs
for
the
whom
Billboard
claims
she
dated
from
October
to
January
and
with
Conor
Kennedy
whom
she
was
linked
to
from
July
to
October
of

It
s
worth
pointing
out
that
with
lines
like
You
really
blew
this
babe
We
ain
t
getting
through
this
one
babe
This
is
the
last
time
I
ll
ever
call
you
babe
the
lyrics
are
vague
enough
that
the
song
could
easily
be
about
a
more
universal
experience
and
not
Swift
s
own
life

However
an
interview
that
Monahan
gave
to
ABC
News
Radio
back
in
seems
to
suggest
that
his
young
collaborator
was
drawing
on
something
more
personal
for
Babe

As
the
Train
singer
told
the
interviewer
It
s
her
song
I
was
just
lucky
enough
to
be
a
part
of
it
with
her

With
that
statement
which
suggests
Swift
s
relationship
with
Gyllenhaal
was
not
necessarily
her
best
all
signs
seem
to
point
his
way

And
indeed
fans
have
speculated
that
Babe
is
about
the
Oscar-nominated
actor
as
well

When
one
fan
asked
her
followers
who
they
thought
the
song
was
about
they
were
quick
to
throw
out
Gyllenhaal
s
name
indicating
what
Obviously
there
s
no
confirmation
yet
but
as
you
can
see
fans
are
pretty
confident
they
ve
cracked
Swift
s
code
on
this
latest
song

They
fully
believe
that
Babe
is
about
Gyllenhaal
cheating
and
as
far
as
they
re
concerned
the
Nightcrawler
star
may
have
some
splainin
to
do

Buckle
up
parents

Your
baby
s
first
year
is
a
whirlwind
of
milestones

You
ve
already
seen
them
take
their
first
breath
heard
their
first
wail
and
changed
their
first
dirty
diaper

Only
a
couple
thousand
more
to
go
So
get
your
cameras
ready
here
are
the
milestones
you
can
expect
during
your
baby
s
magical
first
year
of
life

First
month
It
may
seem
that
your
baby
is
simply
an
eating
pooping
and
sleeping
machine
at
this
point

But
a
lot
is
going
on
in
that
tiny
body

Milestones
to
watch
for
include
Second
month
Your
baby
is
starting
to
act
well
more
baby-like

By
the
end
of
months
your
baby
is
likely
to
be
gurgling
cooing
Third
month
Your
baby
is
progressing
from
dependent
newborn
to
more
independent
baby
yay
you
might
find
those
minutes
to
take
a
shower

This
is
when
some
of
that
cuteness
overload
starts
to
kick
in

Watch
for
Fourth
month
At
this
stage
your
baby
is
taking
the
milestones
already
achieved
and
perfecting
them

For
example
they
may
hold
their
head
up
more
consistently
and
for
longer
periods
grasp
toys
with
more
coordination
Fifth
month
Your
baby
continues
to
grow
explore
and
master

As
their
strength
and
coordination
increase
you
may
notice
that
your
baby
is
rolling
from
tummy
to
back
and
then
back
to
tummy
Sixth
month
Your
baby
s
growing
up

They
may
now
be
sitting
up
briefly
without
any
support
Given
that
they
are
now
getting
better
and
better
at
grasping
and
holding
objects
the
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
says
months
is
a
good
time
to
begin
to
encourage
your
baby
to
use
spoons
and
their
hands
to
feed
themselves

We
re
warning
you
It
won
t
be
pretty

You
can
even
introduce
a
sippy
cup
or
regular
cup
with
help

Seventh
month
Your
baby
continues
to
build
on
what
they
ve
already
learned

Milestones
include
You
might
notice
that
your
little
one
can
now
roll
over
sit
up
and
move
objects
from
hand
to
hand
or
hand
to
mouth
like
a
pro

You
might
also
begin
to
see
your
baby
rocking
back
and
forth
on
their
hands
and
knees
or
scoot
along
the
floor
precursors
to
crawling
pulling
up
to
a
standing
position
drooling
a
lot
some
babies
will
be
cutting
their
first
teeth
around
this
age
continuing
to
babble
was
that
a
random
ma-ma
or
da-da
you
just
heard

developing
stranger
or
separation
anxiety
this
is
a
kind
of
distress
babies
feel
when
they
re
separated
from
their
parents
or
primary
caregivers
Ninth
month
Your
baby
is
on
the
move

They
may
be
crawling
Tenth
month
Your
baby
conintues
to
explore
and
experiment

Watch
your
baby
as
they
re
moving
from
pulling
to
stand
or
crawling
to
cruising
or
walking
Eleventh
month
In
addition
to
reaching
crawling
and
cruising
your
baby
may
be
continuing
to
explore
language
giving
you
more
mamas
dadas
and
Congratulations

You
officially
have
a
toddler
and
you
re
no
worse
for
wear
except
for
maybe
that
time
your
baby
gave
your
hoop
earring
that
really
bad
tug
and
well
we
digress

During
their
twelfth
month
your
baby
will
likely
be
cruising
standing
briefly
unsupported
and
maybe
even
taking
a
step
When
to
talk
with
your
pediatrician
While
most
babies
will
reach
milestones
at
roughly
and
roughly
is
the
operative
word
here
the
same
age
there
s
a
wide
range
of
normal

Your
sister
s
baby
walked
at
months
and
yours
is
still
crawling
at
months

Normal

Your
-month-old
baby
can
pick
up
Cheerios
like
a
vacuum
but
your
neighbor
s
baby
the
same
age
continues
to
struggle

Yep
that
s
normal
too

Babies
born
prematurely
or
with
a
health
issue
or
congenital
disorder
can
also
take
more
time
to
reach
milestones

And
one
study
found
that
girls
tend
to
reach
milestones
before
boys
although
the
differences
weren
t
huge
All
along
the
way
your
baby
s
pediatrician
will
be
looking
out
for
milestones
and
watching
your
baby
s
progress

If
your
baby
s
doctor
feels
there
s
a
need
for
intervention
screening
testing
or
therapies
for
example
they
ll
let
you
know

And
don
t
shrug
off
your
own
intuition

If
you
feel
something
needs
investigation
speak
up

Keep
your
well
baby
appointments
typically
to
in
the
first
year
and
see
them
as
an
opportunity
to
chat
with
your
pediatrician
about
what
s
going
on

Remember
that
the
average
ages
for
reaching
certain
milestones
are
just
that
averages

Some
babies
will
do
things
earlier
while
others
will
do
them
later
and
that
s
all
usually
OK

how
quickly
your

is
picking
up
new
skills

Infant
development
milestones
for
a
to
-month-old
include
sitting
standing
and
laughing

By
Mayo
Clinic
Staff
As
your
baby
becomes
more
mobile
and
curious
infant
development
takes
off

It
might
seem
that
your
baby
learns
something
new
every
day

Understand
these
next
milestones
and
what
you
can
do
to
promote
your
baby
s
growth

What
to
expect
Babies
grow
and
develop
at
their
own
pace

From
ages
to
months
your
baby
is
likely
to
experience
Advancing
motor
skills

By
this
age
most
babies
can
roll
over
in
both
directions
even
in
their
sleep

Most
babies
also
can
sit
on
their
own
while
others
need
a
little
support

You
might
notice
your
baby
beginning
to
scoot
rock
back
and
forth
or
even
crawl
across
the
room

Some
babies
this
age
can
pull
themselves
to
a
standing
position

Soon
your
baby
might
take
some
steps
while
holding
the
edge
of
a
couch
or
low
table

Improved
hand-eye
coordination

Most
babies
this
age
move
objects
from
one
hand
to
another
or
directly
to
their
mouths

Pulling
objects
closer
with
a
raking
motion
of
the
hands
will
give
way
to
more-refined
movements
such
as
picking
up
objects
with
just
the
thumb
and
forefinger

These
skills
will
help
your
baby
handle
a
spoon
and
soft
finger
foods

Evolving
communication

Babies
communicate
through
sounds
gestures
and
facial
expressions

You
ll
probably
hear
plenty
of
laughing
and
squealing

Some
babies
might
repeat
the
sounds
they
hear
or
give
it
their
best
shot

Your
baby
s
babbling
is
likely
to
include
chains
of
sounds
such
as
ba-ba-ba

You
might
even
pick
out
an
occasional
mama
or
dada

Stranger
anxiety

Many
babies
this
age
become
wary
of
strangers

Your
baby
might
resist
staying
with
anyone
other
than
you

If
your
baby
fusses
when
you
leave
the
excitement
of
a
new
toy
or
event
might
provide
a
distraction

Your
baby
will
likely
stop
crying
as
soon
as
you
re
out
of
sight

Teething

Babies
start
getting
teeth
during
this
time

But
teeth
may
come
in
later
too

You
might
notice
your
baby
drooling
more
than
usual
and
chewing
on
just
about
anything

Try
gently
rubbing
the
gums
with
one
of
your
fingers
or
offer
a
rubber
teething
ring

Avoid
teething
gels
or
other
medications

When
your
baby
s
first
teeth
appear
use
a
soft-bristled
toothbrush
to
clean
them

Until
your
child
learns
to
spit
at
about
age
use
a
smear
of
fluoride
toothpaste
no
bigger
than
the
size
of
a
grain
of
rice

Promoting
your
baby
s
development
For
babies
of
any
age
learning
and
play
are
inseparable

To
support
your
budding
adventurer
Create
an
exploration-safe
environment

Keep
only
safe
objects
within
your
baby
s
reach

Move
anything
that
could
be
poisonous
pose
a
choking
hazard
or
break
into
small
pieces

Cover
electrical
outlets
and
use
stairway
gates

Gates
between
rooms
can
help
keep
your
fast-moving
baby
in
safe
areas
too

Place
cords
from
blinds
or
shades
out
of
reach

Install
child
locks
on
doors
and
cabinets

If
you
have
furniture
with
sharp
edges
remove
it
from
rooms
where
your
baby
plays

The
same
goes
for
lightweight
objects
your
baby
can
use
to
pull
up
into
a
standing
position
such
as
plant
stands
small
tables
potted
trees
and
floor
lamps

Anchor
bookcases
televisions
and
their
stands
to
the
wall

Keep
chatting

You
ve
likely
been
talking
to
your
baby
all
along

Keep
it
up

Describe
what
you
re
doing
and
give
your
baby
time
to
reply

After
you
say
something
wait
for
your
baby
to
repeat
the
sounds

Sing
simple
songs

Ask
your
baby
questions
that
involve
more
than
a
yes
or
no
response

You
might
not
be
able
to
pick
words
from
your
baby
s
babble
but
you
can
encourage
a
back-and-forth
conversation

Teach
cause
and
effect

Push
the
button
on
a
musical
toy
and
dance
to
the
tune

Open
the
door
on
a
toy
barn
and
listen
to
the
cow
say
moo

Help
your
baby
do
the
same

Self-confidence
will
grow
as
your
baby
realizes
how
to
make
things
happen

Take
time
to
play

By
now
you
and
your
baby
might
be
very
good
at
games
you
ve
been
playing
such
as
peekaboo
patty-cake
and
itsy-bitsy
spider

Get
creative

Arrange
cushions
and
pillows
on
a
carpeted
floor
and
encourage
your
baby
to
creep
or
crawl
over
them

Stack
blocks
and
invite
your
baby
to
knock
them
down

At
bath
time
provide
small
containers
and
plastic
utensils
for
pouring
and
mixing

Pull
out
the
books

Set
aside
time
for
reading
every
day
even
if
it
s
only
a
few
minutes

Reading
aloud
is
one
of
the
simplest
ways
to
boost
your
baby
s

many
parents
and
godparents
choose
to
dress
the
baby
in
a
white
gown
called
a
christening
gown
for
the
baptism
ceremony

Christening
gowns
often
become

keepsakes
that
are

by
many
other
children
in
the
family
and
handed
down
from
generation
to
During
the
medieval
and
Reformation
eras
infant
baptism
was
seen
as
a
way
to
incorporate
newborn
babies
into
the
secular
community
as
well
as
inducting
them
into
the
Christian
faith

Due
to
high
rates
of
infant
mortality
it
is
important
to
note
that
canon
law
denied
unbaptized
sanctified
by
the
Holy
Spirit

Lutherans
WELS
believe
that
babies
are
conceived
and
born
sinful
and
therefore
need
to
be
born
again
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven

Through
Baptism
the
Holy
Spirit
works
rebirth
creates
faith
in
them
and
saves
them

Although
some
deny
the
possibility
of
infant
faith
the
Bible
clearly
teaches
that
babies
can
believe

Methodist
Churches
especially
so
if
the
practice
is
an
important
one

Jesus
affirmation
According
to
Luke
-
when
parents
brought
their
babies
to
Jesus
the
disciples
tried
to
prevent
them
from
coming

Jesus
becomes
indignant
and
says
Let
the
little
children
come
to
me
and
do
not
hinder
them
for
the
kingdom
of
God
belongs
to
such
as
these

This
seems
to
confirm
that
infants
can
have
a
personal
relationship
with
Jesus
just
as
parents
can
have
a
personal
relationship
with
their
babies

More
importantly
Jesus
confirms
that
babies
of
believers
belong
to
the
kingdom
of
God

In
other
words
babies
of
believers
are
counted
as
believers
not
unbelievers

Therefore
Jesus
specifically
instructs
not
to
hinder
them

Peter
s
speech
According
to
the
Book
of
Acts
Peter
replied
Repent
during
the
Reformation
as
follows
Other
Christians
saw
the
baptism
of
each
new-born
baby
into
the
secular
parish
community
and
close
links
between
church
and
state
as
the
divinely-ordained
means
of
holding
society
together

Hence
many
other
Baptisms
have
sometimes
accidentally
led
to
injuries
or
deaths
such
as
drowning
deaths
to
babies

In
Romania
this
has
served
as
an
opportunity
to
revise
practices

Breastfeeding
is
the
natural
way
to
feed
your
baby

Breast
milk
meets
all
your
baby
s
needs
for
about
the
first
months
of
life

Between
and
months
of
age
your
baby
will
learn
about
new
tastes
and
textures
with
healthy

should
still
remain
an
important
source
of
nutrition

Feed
your

them
to
try
new
tastes
but
without
force
and
watch
closely
to
see
if
they
re
still
hungry

Keep
your
baby
active

They
might
not
be
able
to
run
and
play
like
the
big
kids
just
yet
but
there
s
lots
they
can
do
to
keep

arms
and
legs
moving
throughout
the
day

Getting

saucers
for
too
long

In
the
case
of
suspected
malfunctioning
the
doctor
could
conduct
basic
tests
to
discern
if
the
baby
s
vision
and
hearing
are
affected

For
this
the
doctor
would
check
the
movement
of
the
baby
s
head
in
response
to
a
sound
or

s
ability
to
spot

Topical
ointment
If
the
baby
has
a
bruise
or
small
wound
at
the

baby
should
play
quietly
for
at

car
seat
and
a

could
effectively
