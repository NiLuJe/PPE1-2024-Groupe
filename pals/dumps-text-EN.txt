The

on

on
Monday
A
baby
was
born
on
a
crowded
migrant
dinghy
which
travelled
from
Africa
to
the
Canary
Islands
this
week
Spanish
coast
guards
say

They
have
published
a
picture
of
the
baby
boy
who
was
rescued
on
alongside
his
mother
and
scores
of
other
migrants

The
crowded
inflatable
raft
was
first
spotted
on
January
off
the
island
of
Lanzarote

The
rescuers
believe
they
reached
the
vessel
soon
after
the
baby
was
born
on
the
day
Spain
celebrated
the
Epiphany
a
Christian
holiday
where
children
traditionally
receive
gifts

The
captain
of
the
rescue
boat
said
they
knew
there
was
a
pregnant
woman
on
board
but
were
surprised
to
find
a
totally
naked
baby
who
was
born
or
minutes
earlier
Domingo
Trujillo
said
when
they
reached
the
vessel
the
mother
was
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
packed
raft
while
the
baby
was
being
held
by
another
passenger

The

from

is
notoriously
dangerous

More
than
undocumented
migrants
made
the
route
last
year
to

Blaze

two
children
Dayton
seven

three-year-old
Storm

She
said
her
pregnancy
with
second
child
Arabella
was
not
easy
and
she
had
been
diagnosed
with
gestational
diabetes
and
polyhydramnios
a
condition
that
occurs
during
pregnancy
when
there
is
too
much
amniotic
fluid

In
the
latter
stages
of
her
pregnancy
she
suffered
episodes
of
reduced
movements
and
said
she
grew
more
concerned
each
time
she
was
checked
out
and
sent
home

It
was
these
issues
that
led
to
her
being
admitted
to
hospital
for
an
induction
at
weeks
and
three
days
in
April

But
the
-year-old
said
the
induction
had
been
delayed
by
a
handover

really
bothered

An
investigation
found
issues
with
the
way
Arabella
s
heart

had

A
Healthcare
Safety

Branch
HSIB
report
found
issues
with
how
Arabella
s
heart

was
monitored
after
Tia
had
been

and
said
when
medics
realised
there
was
a
problem
there
had
been
a
delay
before
starting
an
emergency
Caesarean

At
the
inquest
they
admitted
that
if
she
was
born
even
an
hour
before
she
d
still
be
here
perfectly
healthy
and
fine
Tia
said

I
m
angry
every

I
think
what
makes
me
angry
is
this
should
never
have
happened

It
makes
me
angry
when
my
son
asks
about
his
sister
and
where
she
is
and
why
isn
t
she
here

The
HSIB
report
noted
local
policy
guidelines
on
monitoring
the
baby
s
heart
rate
had
not
been

said
We
apologise
unreservedly
for
the
distress
caused
as
a
result
of
Arabella
s
tragic
death
in
May
and
once
again
offer
our
sincere
condolences
to

Many

also
urged

medication
which

Another
mother
has
spoken
about
her
experience
at
a
different
Devon
hospital

While
waiting
for
a
Caesarean
at
North
Devon
District
Hospital
in
February
after
suffering
high
and
low
blood
pressure
Megan
was
given
a
drip
which
contained
oxytocin
rather
than
just
saline

Megan
who
was
at
the
time
and
living
in
Barnstaple
with
her
partner
Cameron
knew
something
was
wrong
within
minutes

The
only
thoughts
running
through
my
mind
was
obviously
that
I
d
seen
Remi
s
heart
rate
so
so
low
and
I
was
just
in
excruciating
pain
she
said

I
remember
turning
to
Cameron
and
telling
him
I
don
t
think
I
m
going
to
make
it
out
The
medication
caused
a
placental
abruption
which
resulted
in
an
emergency
Caesarean
and
her
daughter
suffering
a
brain
injury
due
to
a
lack

has
since

with
epilepsy
and

From
day
dot
she
has
just
proven
that
she

the

wrong
we

some

A
HSIB
investigation
found
the
oxytocin
infusion
was
left
in
the
operating
theatre
unattended
when
staff
were
called
to
an
emergency

This
enabled
the
oxytocin
infusion
to
be
mistakenly
collected
and
used
in
place
of
the
prescribed
intravenous
fluids
investigators
concluded
adding
staff
had
overridden
the
hospital
s
electronic
medication
administration
record
system
in
order
to
give
it
to
Megan

The
hospital
has
since
admitted
liability

A
spokesperson
for
Royal
Devon
University
Healthcare
NHS
Foundation
Trust
said
the
hospital
was
truly
sorry
to
Megan
Remi
and
their
loved
ones
for
the
failings
they
experienced
They
added
We
have
accepted
that
we
could
and
should
have
done
better
for
them
and
we
are
working
with
them
and
their
legal
team
to
agree
compensation
to
support
Remi
in
the
future

Megan
said
It
was
nice
to
finally
be
able
to
say
that
it
s
fully
confirmed
that
it
was
their
mistake

Obviously
you
get
the
anger

all

behind
it

Maternity
services
reviewed
The
safety
of
maternity
services
has
been
under
scrutiny
nationally

The
CQC
carried
out
a
review
of
all
maternity
services
external
across
England
between
-
that
had
not
been
inspected
prior
to
March

The
review
came
after
investigations
from
onwards
into
failings
at
specific
trusts
including
Morecombe
Bay
Shrewsbury
and
Telford
and
East
Kent

An
independent
review
of
maternity
services
at
Nottingham
University
Hospitals
NHS
Trust
which
is
the
largest
inquiry
of
its
kind
in
NHS
history
is
still
ongoing

The
CQC
s
review
of
NHS
units
highlighted
issues
with
staffing
buildings
equipment
and
the
way
safety
was
managed
warning
preventable
harm
was
at
risk
of
becoming
normalised
IFrame
It
found
almost
half
were
rated
as
requires
improvement
or
inadequate
while
only
of
services
were
rated
as
outstanding
and
were
rated
as
good

On
safety
nearly
two
thirds
were
rated
as
either
inadequate
or
requires
improvement
All
four
of
Devon
s
maternity
units
Derriford
North
Devon
District
Hospital
Royal
Devon
and
Exeter
and
Torbay
Hospital
were
found
to
require
improvement
overall
and
in
safety
and
leadership

NDDH
has
repeatedly
been
rated
as
requires
improvement
over
the
last
decade
following
CQC
inspections
in
and
the
latest
in

In
following
a
BBC
investigation
into
baby
deaths
at
the
maternity
unit
then
medical
director
Prof
Adrian
Harris
who
took
over
the
unit
in
said
sweeping
changes
on
the
ward
meant
progress
had
been
made
adding
the
unit
was
completely
different
from
the
boardroom
right
down
to
the
shop
floor
Torbay
Hospital
has
also
repeatedly
failed
to
improve
its
CQC
ratings
having
received
requires
improvement
from
its
last
three
inspections
in
and

Abbie
Aplin
the
director
of
maternity
reform
for
the
Royal
College
of
Midwives
said
midwives
were
really
sad
about
the
state
of
maternity
services
They
re
not
able
to
give
the
care
they
want
to
give
to
women
every
day
they
work
in
fear
most
days
that
something
will
go
wrong
on
their
shift

which
is
completely
unacceptable
she
said

Ms
Aplin
said
recruitment
and
the
retention
of
experienced
staff
was
key

Sadly
we
re
losing
a
lot
of
experienced
midwives
and
that
leaves
junior
midwives
without
the
support
they
need
and
we
need
to
make
that
better

said

s

of

Hannah
Pugliese
and
chief

Penny

said
they
wanted
to
reassure
women
about
maternity
services
in
the
county
Speaking
to
the
BBC
Hannah
Pugliese
who
is
director
of
women
at
NHS
Devon
Integrated
Care
Board
ICB
which
commissions
maternity
services
across
Devon
said
she
wanted
to
reassure
women

We
ve
been
able
to
respond
really
quickly
to
what
the
CQC
has
found
and
what
we
wouldn
t
want
is
for
the
women
and
the
families
in
Devon
to
feel
that
they
were
going
into
maternity
units
that
weren
t
safe
because
we
ve
been
able
to
make
really
rapid
improvement
in
the
areas
that
were
identified
she
said

In
relation
to
North
Devon
District
Hospital
chief
nurse
Penny
Smith
said
There
were
some
really
radical
changes
made
to
improve
the
resilience
of
the
unit
which
has
had
really
good
impact
and
we
need
to
sustain
those
impacts
and
carry
them
forward

Asked
if
it
was
sustainable
to
have
four
maternity
units
in
Devon
or
if
care
needed
to
be
centralised
Ms
Pugliese
said
Those
discussions
are
always
part
of
what
we
re
considering
for
Devon
because
it
s
important
that
we
understand
both
the
needs
of
the
rural
population
and
the
needs
of
those
living
in
town

Ms
Pugliese
added
no
changes
would
be
made
without
consultation
as
the
public
s
view
was
really
important

Driving
up
standards
A
Department
of
Health
and
Social
Care
spokesperson
said
the
NHS
was
broken
and
women
were
not
receiving
the
safe
personalised
and
compassionate
maternity
care
they
deserve
We
are
committed
to
driving
up
standards
in
healthcare
through
our
Plan
for
Change
the
spokesperson
added

We
will
support
trusts
failing
on
maternity
care
to
make
rapid
improvements
and
work
closely
with
NHS
England
to
train
thousands
more
midwives
to
support
women
throughout
their
pregnancy
and
beyond

Tia
and
Megan
said
they
had
shared
their
stories
in
the
hope
it
would
make
a
difference
and
other
families
would
not
have
to
go
through
what
they
had

Megan
said
For
something
so
tragic
to
go
wrong
and
I
m
not
the
only
one
that
s
gone
through
something
like
this
what
s
it
going
to
take
to
make
a
change

Tia
added
They
can
t
keep
letting
this
happen

One

A
parent
s
guide
Wondering
how
to
do
a
baby
bath

Here
s
a
step-by-step
guide
to
help
you
master
the
basics

By
Mayo
Clinic
Staff
Are
you
nervous
about
giving
your
newborn
baby
a
bath

Bathing
a
slippery
baby
may
feel
daunting
at
first
but
with
a
little
practice
you
ll
start
to
feel
more
comfortable
at
bath
time

Start
by
learning
baby
bath
basics

How
often
does
my
newborn
need
a
bath

There
s
no
need
to
give
your
newborn
baby
a
bath
every
day

Three
times
a
week
might
be
enough
until
your
baby
becomes
more
mobile

Bathing
your
baby
too
much
can
dry
out
your
baby
s
skin

If
you
re
quick
and
thorough
with
diaper
changes
and
burp
cloths
you
re
already
cleaning
the
parts
that
need
attention
the
face
neck
and
diaper
area

Between
baths
you
may
also
check
the
folds
of
your
baby
s
skin
including
thighs
groin
armpits
and
chin

If
needed
clean
these
areas
with
a
wet
washcloth

Is
it
better
to
bathe
my
baby
in
the
morning
or
at
night

That
s
up
to
you

Choose
a
time
when
you
re
not
rushed
or
likely
to
be
interrupted

Some
parents
opt
for
morning
baths
when
their
babies
are
alert

Others
prefer
to
make
baby
baths
part
of
a
calming
bedtime
ritual

If
you
bathe
your
baby
after
a
feeding
consider
waiting
for
your
baby
s
tummy
to
settle
a
bit
first

Is
a
sponge
bath
good
enough

The
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
recommends
sponge
baths
until
the
umbilical
cord
stump
falls
off
which
might
take
a
week
or
two

To
give
your
baby
a
sponge
bath
you
ll
need
A
warm
place
with
a
flat
surface

A
bathroom
or
kitchen
counter
changing
table
or
firm
bed
will
work

Even
a
blanket
or
towel
on
the
floor
is
OK

Pad
hard
surfaces
with
a
blanket
or
towel

A
soft
blanket
towel
or
changing
pad

Spread
it
out
for
your
baby
to
lie
on

A
free
hand

Always
keep
one
hand
on
your
baby

On
a
changing
table
use
the
safety
strap
as
well

A
sink
or
shallow
basin
to
hold
the
water

Run
warm
water
into
the
basin
or
sink

Check
the
water
temperature
with
your
hand
to
make
sure
it
s
not
too
hot

Essential
supplies

Gather
a
washcloth
a
towel
preferably
with
a
built-in
hood
fragrance-free
baby
shampoo
and
soap
baby
wipes
a
clean
diaper
and
a
change
of
clothes

Undress
your
baby
and
wrap
him
or
her
in
a
towel

Lay
your
baby
on
his
or
her
back
in
the
prepared
area

To
keep
your
baby
warm
only
expose
the
parts
of
your
baby
s
body
that
you
re
washing

Wet
the
washcloth
with
plain
warm
water

Then
wring
out
excess
water
and
wipe
your
baby
s
face

Wipe
each
eyelid
from
the
inside
to
the
outside
corner

To
clean
your
baby
s
body
use
a
dampened
washcloth
dipped
in
plain
or
soapy
water

If
you
use
soap
make
sure
it
s
mild
and
moisturizing

Pay
special
attention
to
creases
under
the
arms
behind
the
ears
around
the
neck
and
in
the
diaper
area

Also
wash
between
your
baby
s
fingers
and
toes

What
type
of
baby
tub
is
best

Once
your
baby
is
ready
for
a
bath
you
might
use
a
plastic
tub
or
the
sink

Line
the
tub
or
sink
with
a
clean
towel

Gather
the
supplies
you
d
use
for
a
sponge
bath
a
cup
of
rinsing
water
and
baby
shampoo
if
needed
ahead
of
time

This
will
allow
you
to
keep
one
hand
on
the
baby
at
all
times

Never
leave
your
baby
alone
in
the
water

How
much
water
should
I
put
in
the
tub

A
common
recommendation
is
inches
about
centimeters
During
bath
time
always
be
sure
to
give
your
baby
undivided
attention
and
hold
your
baby
securely

If
you
forget
something
you
need
for
the
bath
take
your
baby
with
you

Never
leave
your
baby
alone
in
the
tub
even
for
an
instant

What
about
water
temperature

Warm
water
is
best

To
prevent
scalding
set
the
thermostat
on
your
water
heater
to
below
F
C
Always
check
the
water
temperature
with
your
hand
before
bathing
your
baby

Aim
for
bath
water
around
F
C
Be
sure
the
room
is
comfortably
warm
too

A
wet
baby
can
be
easily
chilled

What
s
the
best
way
to
hold
my
newborn
in
the
tub

A
secure
hold
will
help
your
baby
feel
comfortable
and
stay
safe
in
the
tub

Use
your
nondominant
arm
to
support
your
baby
s
head
and
neck
and
the
other
to
hold
and
guide
your
baby
s
body
into
the
water
feet
first

Continue
supporting
your
baby
s
head
and
back
as
needed

You
might
reach
behind
your
baby
and
hold
on
to
his
or
her
opposite
arm
throughout
the
bath

What
should
I
wash
first

Most
parents
start
with
the
baby
s
head
and
face
and
move
down
to
dirtier
parts
of
the
body

This
keeps
rinsed
areas
from
getting
soapy
again

Should
I
wash
my
newborn
s
hair

If
your
newborn
has
hair
and
you
think
it
needs
washing
go
ahead

With
your
free
hand
gently
massage
a
drop
of
mild
baby
shampoo
into
your
baby
s
scalp

Rinse
the
shampoo
with
a
cup
of
water
or
a
damp
washcloth
cupping
one
hand
across
your
baby
s
forehead
to
keep
suds
out
of
his
or
her
eyes

Will
lotion
after
a
baby
bath
help
prevent
rashes

Most
newborns
don
t
need
lotion
after
a
bath

If
your
baby
s
skin
is
very
dry
apply
a
small
amount
of
unscented
baby
moisturizer
to
the
dry
areas

The
massage
might
make
your
baby
feel
good

If
dryness
continues
you
might
be
bathing
your
baby
too
often

according
to
San

Jose
Israel
Teran
Jr

is
charged
with
prohibition
of
the

to
one
count
of
aggravated

with
a
deadly

from
Monday
s
shooting
records
with
the
Bexar
County
Jail
show

Police
said
that
on
Dec

Teran
was
mistakingly
added
to
a
group
text
message
of
family
members
discussing
the
details
of
a
-month-old
s
baptism

According
to
an
affidavit
for
his
arrest
Teran
who
was
not
part
of
the
family
responded
That
s
a
nice
Caucasian
baby
how
much
you
want

The
creator
of
the
group
thread
discovered
that
her
uncle
had
changed
his
cell
phone
number
which
was
now
being
used
by
Teran

She
told
Teran
wrong
number
and
proceeded
to
block
him

Teran
continued
to
text
in
the
group
thread
asking
Are
you
not
interested
in
selling

I
m
willing
to
start
the
bid
at
the
affidavit
stated

The
-month-old
s
father
called
Teran
who
said
he
purchased
babies
for
their
organs
and
was
willing
to
pay
for
the
baby
in
cash
or
bitcoin
according
to
the
affidavit

Teran
said
he
was
willing
to
meet
the
same
night
for
the
purchase
and
confirmed
he
knew
the
address
of
the
church
where
the
baptism
was
scheduled
and
their
home
address
which
was
sent
earlier
in
the
group
thread
the
affidavit
stated

When
questioned
about
the
messages
Teran
told
police
he
thought
the
group
thread
was
spam

Suspect

taken
into
custody
for
shooting
Teran
was
charged
earlier
this
week

he
pulled
out
a
gun
and
shot
a
man
inside
a

in
the
leg

The
two
vehicles
eventually
crashed
along
the
road

The
driver
of
the
semi-truck
was
taken
to
a
hospital
for
treatment
SAPD
said

Teran
was

Try
this
by
passing
a
toy
back
and
forth

Read
to
your
baby

Reading
can
be
talking
about
pictures

For
example
while
looking
at
books
or
magazines
name
the
pictures
as
you
point
to
them

Limit
screen
time
TV
tablets
phones
etc

to
video
calling
with
loved
ones

Screen
time
is
not
recommended
for
children
younger
than
years
of
age

Babies
learn
by
talking
playing
and
interacting
with
others

Find
out
about
choking
risks
and
safe
foods
to
feed
your
baby

Let
him
practice
feeding
himself
with
his
fingers
and
using
a
cup
with
a
small
amount
of
water

Sit
next
to
your
baby
and
enjoy
mealtime
together

Expect
spills

Learning
is
messy
and
fun

Ask
for
behaviors
that
you
want

For
example
instead
of
saying
don
t
stand
say
time
to
sit

Help
your
baby
get
used
to
foods
with
different
tastes
and
textures

Foods
can
be
smooth
mashed
or
finely
chopped

Your
baby
might
not
like
every
food
on
the
first
try

Give
her
a
chance
to
try
foods
again
and
again

Say
a
quick
and
cheerful
goodbye
instead
of
sneaking
away
so
your
baby
knows
you
are
leaving
even
if
he
cries

He
will
learn
to
calm
himself
and
what
to
expect

Let
him
know
when
you
return
by
saying
Daddy
s
back

Have
routines
for
sleeping
and
feeding

Babies
do
better
when
they
know
what
to
expect

Stay
close
by
as
your
baby
explores
and
moves
around
your
home
so
she
knows
that
you
are
near

Make
sure
your
baby
gets
enough
sleep

hours
of
sleep
a
day
including
naps
Consistent

it
easier

Take
care
of
yourself

Parenting
can
be
hard
work

It
is
easier
to
enjoy
your

baby
and
be
a
loving
parent
when
you
feel
good
yourself

Make
it
a
game
when
your

There
are
three
stages
of
fetal
development
germinal
embryonic
and
fetal

Most
people
don
t
talk
about
their
pregnancy
in
these
terms
but
it
can
be
helpful
to
know

Germinal
stage
The
germinal
stage
is
the
shortest
stage
of
fetal
development

It
begins
at
conception
when
a
sperm
and
egg
join
in
your
fallopian
tube

The
sperm
fertilizes
the
egg
and
creates
a
zygote

The
zygote
begins
its
journey
down
to
your
uterus
over
the
course
of
about
one
week

During
this
journey
the
zygote
divides
many
times
eventually
creating
two
separate
structures

One
structure
eventually
becomes
the
embryo
and
later
the
fetus
and
the
other
becomes
the
placenta

Cell
division
continues
at
a
rapid
pace

Eventually
the
zygote
turns
into
a
blastocyst

The
blastocyst
arrives
at
your
uterus
and
implants
into
your
uterine
lining

If
implantation
is
successful
your
body
immediately
begins
producing
hormones
to
support
a
pregnancy

This
also
stops
your
menstrual
period

Embryonic
stage
The
embryonic
stage
lasts
from
about
the
third
week
of
pregnancy
until
the
end
of
the
eighth
week
of
pregnancy

The
blastocyst
begins
to
take
on
distinct
human
characteristics

It
s
now
called
an
embryo

Structures
and
organs
like
the
neural
tube
which
later
becomes
the
brain
and
spinal
cord
head
eyes
mouth
and
limbs
form

The
cells
that
will
form
the
fetal
heart
begin
to
cluster
around
five
to
six
weeks
and
can
pulse

Buds
that
will
become
arms
and
legs
also
form
around
the
sixth
week

By
the
end
of
the
eighth
week
most
of
the
embryo
s
organs
and
systems
take
shape

For
a
lot
of
people
this
is
the
point
in
pregnancy
where
morning
sickness
begins

Advertisement
Fetal
stage
The
fetal
stage
of
development
begins
around
the
ninth
week
and
lasts
until
birth

This
is
when
the
embryo
officially
turns
into
a
fetus

The
fetus
gets
its
assigned
sex
around
nine
weeks
of
pregnancy
although
your
healthcare
provider
can
t
detect
it
on
ultrasound
yet

The
fetus
s
major
organs
and
body
systems
continue
to
grow
and
mature

Things
like
fingernails
eyelashes
and
hair
also
grow

The
fetus
is
able
to
move
its
limbs
although
you
may
not
feel
it
until
weeks
of
pregnancy

The
majority
of
growth
in
both
weight
and
length
happens
in
the
fetal
stage

When
does
a
pregnancy
start

The
start
of
pregnancy
is
actually
the
first
day
of
your
last
menstrual
period
LMP
This
is
the
gestational
age
of
the
fetus

It
s
about
two
weeks
ahead
of
when
conception
actually
occurs

Though
it
may
seem
strange
the
date
of
the
first
day
of
your
last
period
will
be
an
important
date
when
determining
your
due
date

Your
healthcare
provider
will
ask
you
about
this
date
and
will
use
it
to
figure
out
how
far
along
you
are
in
your
pregnancy

How
does
conception
work

Each
month
your
body
goes
through
a
reproductive
cycle
that
can
end
in
one
of
two
ways

You
ll
either
have
a
menstrual
period
or
become
pregnant

This
cycle
is
continuously
happening
during
your
reproductive
years
from
starting
your
period
to
menopause
around
age

In
a
cycle
that
ends
with
pregnancy
there
are
several
steps

First
a
group
of
eggs
called
oocytes
gets
ready
to
leave
your
ovary
for
ovulation
release
of
the
egg
The
eggs
develop
in
small
fluid-filled
cysts
called
follicles

Think
of
these
follicles
as
small
containers
for
each
immature
egg

Out
of
this
group
of
eggs
one
will
become
mature
and
continue
through
the
cycle

The
mature
follicle
now
opens
and
releases
the
egg
from
your
ovary

This
is
ovulation

After
ovulation
the
opened
follicle
develops
into
a
structure
called
the
corpus
luteum

This
releases
the
hormones
progesterone
and
estrogen

Progesterone
helps
prepare
your
uterine
lining
for
pregnancy

If
you
don
t
become
pregnant
during
a
cycle
this
lining
is
what
your
body
sheds
during
your
period

If
sperm
fertilizes
the
egg
conception
occurs
and
the
fertilized
egg
begins
its
journey
to
your
uterus
where
it
will
implant

How
long
is
a
pregnancy

Traditionally
we
think
of
pregnancy
as
a
nine-month
process

However
this
isn
t
always
the
case

A
full-term
pregnancy
is
weeks
or
days

Depending
on
what
months
you
re
pregnant
during
some
are
shorter
and
some
longer
and
what
week
you
deliver
you
could
be
pregnant
for
either
nine
months
or
months

This
is
completely
normal
and
healthy

Stages
of
Growth
Month-by-Month
in
Pregnancy
The
fetus
will
change
a
lot
throughout
a
typical
pregnancy

This
time
is
divided
into
three
stages
called
trimesters

Each
trimester
is
a
set
of
about
three
months

Your
healthcare
provider
will
probably
talk
to
you
about
fetal
development
in
terms
of
weeks

So
if
you
re
three
months
pregnant
you
re
about
weeks

You
ll
see
distinct
changes
in
the
fetus
and
yourself
during
each
trimester
of
pregnancy

First
trimester
The
first
trimester
will
span
from
conception
to
weeks

This
is
generally
the
first
three
months
of
pregnancy

During
this
trimester
the
fertilized
egg
will
change
from
a
small
grouping
of
cells
to
a
fetus
that
begins
to
have
human
features

The
first
trimester
is
exciting
but
also
when
most
people
develop
unpleasant
symptoms
like
morning
sickness
and
fatigue

first
two
weeks
of
pregnancy
are
a
getting
ready
period

Your
body
slowly
releases
more
hormones
and
your
uterus
prepares
for
a
potential
pregnancy

At
the
end
of
the
second
week
your
ovary
releases
an
egg
ovulation
If
sperm
meets
an
egg
just
after
ovulation
the
process
to
pregnancy
continues

Week
Fertilization
occurs
during
the
third
week

A
sperm
and
egg
join
and
create
a
zygote

Week
The
tiny
bundle
of
cells
turns
into
a
blastocyst
and
implants
into
your
uterine
lining

The
beginning
of
what
will
become
the
placenta
forms

A
water-tight
sac
forms
around
the
blastocyst

This
is
the
amniotic
sac
and
it
provides
cushioning
to
a
fetus
during
pregnancy

By
the
end
of
the
fourth
week
the
blastocyst
is
about
millimeters
mm
long
the
size
of
a
poppy
seed

Month
weeks
through
The
second
month
of
pregnancy
is
when
most
people
realize
they
re
pregnant

Pregnancy
hormones
go
into
overdrive
and
by
about
the
fifth
week
an
at-home
pregnancy
test
will
show
as
positive

This
is
when
many
people
begin
to
feel
symptoms
of
pregnancy

Week
The
neural
tube
brain
spinal
cord
and
other
neural
tissue
of
the
central
nervous
system
forms

The
tiny
heart
tube
will
pulse
times
a
minute
by
the
end
of
the
fifth
week

Week
Tiny
buds
that
become
arms
and
legs
also
develop

Blood
cells
are
taking
shape
and
circulation
will
begin

Structures
that
ll
become
the
ears
eyes
and
mouth
take
form

Your
healthcare
provider
can
probably
detect
pulses
in
the
cluster
of
cells
that
will
form
the
heart
on
a
vaginal
ultrasound

Week
Bones
begin
replacing
soft
cartilage
and
genitals
begin
to
form

The
embryo
s
head
is
large
in
proportion
to
the
rest
of
its
body

Some
people
think
the
embryo
resembles
a
small
tadpole
or
seahorse
due
to
its
prominent
tail
which
recedes
and
large
head

Week
All
of
the
major
organs
and
body
systems
are
developing

The
embryo
has
web-like
hands
and
feet

Eyes
become
visible
and
ears
begin
to
form

The
umbilical
cord
is
fully
developed
and
helps
to
transport
oxygen
and
blood
to
the
embryo

Advertisement
After
the
week
healthcare
providers
refer
to
the
embryo
as
a
fetus

It
will
remain
a
fetus
until
birth

By
the
end
of
the
second
month
the
fetus
is
about
to
inch
in
long
about
the
size
of
a
black
bean

Month
weeks
through
The
third
month
of
pregnancy
is
when
an
embryo
becomes
a
fetus

It
s
a
period
of
rapid
growth
and
development

The
fetus
develops
distinct
facial
features
limbs
organs
bones
and
muscles

By
the
end
of
the
week
the
fetus
has
an
assigned
sex
but
it
won
t
be
visible
on
ultrasound
for
several
more
weeks

Week
The
beginnings
of
teeth
and
taste
buds
are
forming

Its
muscles
are
forming
and
its
body
shape
takes
on
more
of
a
human
appearance

But
its
head
is
still
of
its
length

Your
provider
may
be
able
to
hear
its
heartbeat
with
a
Doppler
ultrasound

Week
The
arms
hands
fingers
feet
and
toes
are
fully
formed
no
more
webbed
fingers
Fingernails
and
toenails
are
beginning
to
develop
and
the
external
ears
form

The
external
genitals
also
begin
to
form
but
it
s
too
soon
to
see
them
on
an
ultrasound

Week
The
fetus
is
starting
to
explore
a
bit
by
doing
things
like
opening
and
closing
its
fists
and
mouth

Its
knees
elbows
and
ankles
are
working
but
it
s
too
soon
to
feel
any
kicks

The
bones
are
hardening
but
its
skin
is
still
see-through

Facial
features
are
more
prominent

Week
All
the
organs
limbs
bones
and
muscles
are
present
and
will
continue
to
develop
in
order
to
become
fully
functional

The
circulatory
digestive
and
urinary
systems
are
also
working
and
the
liver
produces
bile

The
fetus
is
drinking
and
peeing
amniotic
fluid

Since
the
most
critical
development
has
taken
place
your
chance
of
miscarriage
drops
considerably
after
weeks
the
end
of
the
first
trimester
Most
people
begin
feeling
some
relief
from
morning
sickness
now
too

At
the
end
of
the
third
month
the
fetus
is
about
to
inches
long
about
the
size
of
a
plum

Second
trimester
The
second
trimester
of
pregnancy
is
often
thought
of
as
the
best
part
of
the
experience

By
this
time
any
morning
sickness
is
probably
gone
and
the
discomfort
of
early
pregnancy
has
faded

You
may
also
start
to
feel
movement
as
the
fetus
flips
and
turns
in
your
uterus

During
this
trimester
many
people
find
out
about
the
fetus
s
assigned
sex

This
is
typically
done
during
an
anatomy
scan
an
ultrasound
that
checks
physical
development
at
around
weeks

Month
weeks
through
Many
people
begin
showing
signs
of
being
pregnant
at
this
point
in
pregnancy
especially
if
you
ve
been
pregnant
before

Your
pregnancy
care
provider
can
hear
the
fetal
heartbeat
loud
and
clear
on
a
Doppler
ultrasound

The
fetus
can
even
suck
its
thumb
yawn
stretch
and
make
faces

Week
Vocal
cords
form
and
the
fetus
s
large
head
begins
to
grow
proportionate
to
its
body

Week
The
fetus
s
skin
starts
to
thicken
and
fine
hair
begins
to
grow

It
can
start
bringing
its
fingers
to
its
mouth
and
turn
its
head

External
genitals
are
fully
developed
and
fingerprints
begin
to
form

Week
Some
organs
like
intestines
and
ears
are
moving
to
their
permanent
location

The
fetus
still
uses
amniotic
fluid
to
practice
breathing
but
its
lungs
are
beginning
to
develop

The
fetus
begins
to
make
more
purposeful
movements
like
sucking
its
thumb
or
smiling

Week
The
fetus
has
lips
and
its
ears
are
developed
enough
that
it
can
hear
you
talk

Even
though
its
eyes
are
closed
the
fetus
can
react
to
light
by
turning
away
from
it

By
the
end
of
the
fourth
month
the
fetus
is
about
inches
long
and
weighs
about
ounces

For
reference
that
s
about
as
big
as
an
avocado

Month
weeks
through
By
the
end
of
the
fifth
month
of
pregnancy
most
people
begin
to
feel
the
fetus
moving
around

The
first
movements
are
called
quickening
and
can
feel
like
a
flutter

If
your
pregnancy
has
been
healthy
to
this
point
you
ll
finally
get
your
first
ultrasound

You
may
even
get
to
find
out
the
fetus
s
assigned
sex

Week
The
fetus
still
has
thin
skin
but
will
start
to
put
on
fat

Its
skin
is
covered
with
a
whitish
coating
called
vernix

This
cheesy
substance
is
thought
to
protect
fetal
skin
from
long-term
exposure
to
amniotic
fluid

Week
The
fetus
is
covered
in
lanugo
a
peach
fuzz-like
hair

It
helps
keep
the
fetus
warm
and
provides
another
layer
of
protection

The
fetus
may
have
a
sleep-wake
cycle
and
loud
noises
may
wake
the
fetus
if
it
s
asleep

Week
The
fetus
is
getting
stronger
and
most
people
begin
to
feel
kicks
and
punches

The
fetus
also
has
its
own
unique
set
of
fingerprints
and
can
hiccup

Week
The
fetus
s
nails
grow
towards
the
end
of
its
fingers

The
area
of
the
brain
responsible
for
its
five
senses
begins
to
develop

By
the
end
of
the
fifth
month
the
fetus
is
about
to
inches
long
and
weighs
about
pound

Month
weeks
through
If
you
could
look
inside
your
uterus
right
now
you
d
see
that
the
fetus
s
skin
is
reddish
in
color
wrinkled
and
veins
are
visible
through
translucent
skin

In
the
sixth
month
of
pregnancy
its
eyelids
begin
to
part
and
you
may
notice
regular
jerky
movements

The
fetus
responds
to
sounds
by
moving
or
increasing
its
pulse

Week
Limb
movements
are
coordinated
and
frequent

The
fetus
has
bone
marrow
that
helps
it
produce
blood
cells

Week
The
fetus
s
grasp
is
getting
stronger
and
it
can
touch
its
ears
and
the
umbilical
cord

It
can
hear
your
heartbeat
your
stomach
rumble
and
your
breathing

Week
If
born
prematurely
the
fetus
may
survive
after
the
week
with
intensive
care

It
will
begin
rapidly
adding
fat
to
its
body

Week
The
fetus
s
lungs
are
fully
developed
but
not
well
enough
to
work
outside

uterus

By
the
end
of
the
sixth
month
the
fetus
is
about
inches
long
and
weighs
about
pounds

Month
weeks
through
The
fetus
continues
to
mature
and
develop
reserves
of
body
fat

The
fetus
changes
position
frequently
and
responds
to
stimuli
including
sound
pain
and
light

The
amniotic
fluid
begins
to
diminish

Week
More
body
fat
makes
the
fetus
s
skin
less
wrinkled
and
plumper

Its
nervous
system
is
quickly
maturing

Week
The
fetus
makes
melanin
the
substance
that
gives
skin
and
eyes
their
color

The
fetus
s
lungs
start
to
make
surfactant
a
substance
that
helps
it
breathe
after
birth

Week
The
fetus
can
open
its
eyes
and
blink

It
also
has
eyelashes

Week
The
fetus
may
begin
turning
head-down
in
your
uterus
as
it
gets
ready
for
birth

At
the
end
of
the
seventh
month
the
fetus
is
about
to
inches
long
and
weighs
between
and
pounds

Third
trimester
This
is
the
final
part
of
your
pregnancy

You
may
be
tempted
to
start
counting
down
the
days
to
your
due
date
and
hope
that
it
comes
early
but
each
week
of
this
final
stage
of
development
helps
the
fetus
prepare
for
birth

Throughout
the
third
trimester
the
fetus
gains
weight
quickly
adding

Additional
Common
Questions
How
early
can
I
know
I
m
pregnant

From
the
moment
of
conception
the
hormone
human
chorionic
gonadotrophin
HCG
will
be
present
in
your
blood

This
hormone
is
created
by
the
cells
that
form
the
placenta
food
source
for
the
growing
fetus
It
s
also
the
hormone
detected
in
a
pregnancy
test

Even
though
this
hormone
is
there
from
the
beginning
it
takes
time
for
it
to
build
within
your
body

It
typically
takes
three
to
four
weeks
from
the
first
day
of
your
last
period
for
the
HCG
to
increase
enough
to
be
detected
by
pregnancy
tests

When
should
I
reach
out
to
my
healthcare
provider
about
a
new
pregnancy

Most
healthcare
providers
will
have
you
wait
to
come
in
for
an
appointment
until
you
ve
had
a
positive
home
pregnancy
test

These
tests
are
very
accurate
once
you
have
enough
HCG
circulating
throughout
your
body

This
can
be
a
few
weeks
after
conception

It
s
best
to
call
your
healthcare
provider
once
you
have
a
positive
pregnancy
test
to
schedule
your
first
appointment

When
you
call
your
healthcare
provider
may
ask
you
if
you
re
taking
a
prenatal
vitamin

These
supplements
contain
folic
acid

It
s
important
that
you
get
at
least
mcg
of
folic
acid
each
day
during
pregnancy
to
make
sure
the
fetus
s
neural
tube
beginning
of
the
brain
and
spine
develops
correctly

Many
healthcare
providers
suggest
that
you
take
prenatal
vitamins
with
folic
acid
even
when
you
aren
t
pregnant

If
you
weren
t
taking
prenatal
vitamins
before
your
pregnancy
your
provider
may
ask
you
to
start
as
soon
as
possible

What
weeks
are
most
important
for
fetal
development

Each
trimester
or
phase
of
pregnancy
carries
its
own
unique
risks

It
s
hard
to
pinpoint
specific
weeks
as
being
more
or
less
important

However
most
healthcare
providers
will
say
the
most
important
time
for
fetal
development
is
the
first
weeks
of
the
pregnancy
or
the
first
trimester
The
risk
of
miscarriage
drops
after
the
first
trimester
when
the
fetus
s
major
organs
and
systems
are
formed
and
working

This
isn
t
to
say
that
your
pregnancy
becomes
less
important
after
weeks

It
just
means
a
lot
of
the
critical
steps
and
processes
are
complete
and
that
a
lot
of
the
most
major
birth
disorders
occur
in
the
first
trimester

What
does
full-term
mean
in
a
pregnancy

Once
you
get
close
to
the
end
of
your
pregnancy
healthcare
providers
may
use
several
terms
to
describe
when
you
go
into
labor

These
terms
are
labels
that
divide
up
the
last
few
weeks
of
pregnancy

They
re
helpful
in
determining
how
likely
a
baby
is
to
have
complications
at
birth

For
example
babies
that
are
born
in
the
early
term
period
or
before
it
generally
have
a
higher
risk
of
breathing
issues
than
babies
born
at
full
term

When
you
re
looking
at
these
labels
it
s
important
to
know
how
they
re
written

You
may
see
the
week
first
and
then
two
numbers
separated
by
a
slash
mark
This
stands
for
how
many
days
you
currently
are
in
the
gestational
week

So
if
you
see
it
means
that
you
re
on
day
of
your
week

The
last
few
weeks
of
pregnancy
are
divided
into
the
following
groups
Early-term
weeks
through
weeks

Full-term
weeks
through
weeks

Late-term
weeks
through
weeks

Post-term
weeks
and
on

Talk
to
your
healthcare
provider
about
any
questions
you
may
have
about
gestational
age
and
due
date

A
note
from
Cleveland
Clinic
There
s
a
lot
that
needs
to
happen
for
a
pregnancy
to
occur
grow
and
result
in
a
birth

Learning
about
how
the
fetus
grows
can
be
exciting
and
eye-opening
especially
when
you
realize
how
many
organs
systems
and
body
functions
develop
within
a
nine-month
period

Both
you
and
the
fetus
growing
inside
of
you
go
through
many
changes
during
pregnancy

Ask
your
pregnancy
care
provider
about
these
changes
and
any
other
questions
you
have

They
re
there
to
be
a
resource
to
you
and
give
you
the
best
possible
care

Causes

Complications
Overview
Colic
is
frequent
prolonged
and
intense
crying
or
fussiness
in
a
healthy
infant

Colic
can
be
particularly
frustrating
for
parents
because
the
baby
s
distress
occurs
for
no
apparent
reason
and
no
amount
of
consoling
seems
to
bring
any
relief

These
episodes
often
occur
in
the
evening
when
parents
themselves
are
often
tired

Episodes
of
colic
usually
peak
when
an
infant
is
about
weeks
old
and
decline
significantly
after
to
months
of
age

While
the
excessive
crying
will
resolve
with
time
managing
colic
adds
significant
stress
to
caring
for
your
newborn
child

You
can
take
steps
that
may
lessen
the
severity
and
duration
of
colic
episodes
alleviate
your
own
stress
and
bolster
confidence
in
your
parent-child
connection

Clinic
Guide
to
Your
Baby
s
First
Years
Symptoms
Babies
have
been
known
to
fuss
and
cry
especially
during
the
first
three
months
of
life

The
range
for
what
s
considered
typical
crying
is
difficult
to
pin
down

In
general
colic
is
defined
as
crying
for
three
or
more
hours
a
day
three
or
more
days
a
week
for
three
or
more
weeks

Features
of
colic
may
include
the
following
Intense
crying
that
may
seem
more
like
screaming
or
an
expression
of
pain
Crying
for
no
apparent
reason
unlike
crying
to
express
hunger
or
the
need
for
a
diaper
change
Extreme
fussiness
even
after
crying
has
diminished
Predictable
timing
with
episodes
often
occurring
in
the
evening
Facial
discoloring
such
as
skin
flushing
or
blushing
Body
tension
such
as
pulled
up
or
stiffened
legs
stiffened
arms
clenched
fists
arched
back
or
tense
abdomen
Sometimes
there
is
relief
in
symptoms
after
the
infant
passes
gas
or
has
a
bowel
movement

Gas
is
likely
the
result
of
swallowed
air
during
prolonged
crying

When
to
see
a
doctor
Excessive
inconsolable
crying
may
be
colic
or
an
indication
of
an
illness
or
condition
that
causes
pain
or
discomfort

Schedule
an
appointment
with
your
child
s
health
care
provider
for
a
thorough
exam
if
your
infant
experiences
excessive
crying
or
other
signs
or
symptoms
of
colic

Causes
The
cause
of
colic
is
unknown

It
may
result
from
numerous
contributing
factors

While
a
number
of
causes
have
been
explored
it
s
difficult
for
researchers
to
account
for
all
the
important
features
such
as
why
it
usually
begins
late
in
the
first
month
of
life
how
it
varies
among
infants
why
it
happens
at
certain
times
of
day
and
why
it
resolves
on
its
own
in
time

Possible
contributing
factors
that
have
been
explored
include
Digestive
system
that
isn
t
fully
developed
Imbalance
of
healthy
bacteria
in
the
digestive
tract
Food
allergies
or
intolerances
Overfeeding
underfeeding
or
infrequent
burping
Early
form
of
childhood
migraine
Family
stress
or
anxiety
Risk
factors
Risk
factors
for
colic
are
not
well-understood

Research
has
not
shown
differences
in
risk
when
the
following
factors
were
considered
Sex
of
the
child
Preterm
and
full-term
pregnancies
Formula-fed
and
breast-fed
babies
Infants
born
to
mothers
who
smoked
during
pregnancy
or
after
delivery
have
an
increased
risk
of
developing
colic

Complications
Colic
does
not
cause
short-term
or
long-term
medical
problems
for
a
child

Colic
is
stressful
for
parents

Research
has
shown
an
association
between
colic
and
the
following
problems
with
parent
well-being
Increased
risk
of
postpartum
depression
in
mothers
Early
cessation
of
breast-feeding
Feelings
of
guilt
exhaustion
helplessness
or
anger
Shaken
baby
syndrome
The
stress
of
calming
a
crying
baby
has
sometimes
prompted
parents
to
shake
or
otherwise
harm
their
child

Shaking
a
baby
can
cause
serious
damage
to
the
brain
and
death

The
risk
of
these
uncontrolled
reactions
is
greater
if
parents
don
t
have
information
about
soothing
a
crying
child
education
about
colic
and
the
support
needed
for
caring
for
an
infant
with
colic

Taking
a
baby
on
a
plane
is
something
that
most
parents
approach
with
caution

Infants
and
air
travel
can
both
be
unpredictable
and
they
don
t
always
mix
well

But
some
advanced
planning
and
preparation
can
help
make
for
a
better
experience
for
your
baby
for
you
and
for
everyone
else
on
the
plane

Here
are
answers
to
some
questions
you
may
have
before
traveling
with
an
infant
along
with
tips
for
a
smoother
and
safer
flight

When
is
my
baby
old
enough
to
fly
on
an
airplane

Generally
you
should
avoid
flying
with
your
newborn
until
they
are
at
least
days
old

Ideally
wait
until
your
baby
is
two
or
three
months
old
to
fly

Air
travel
and
being
in
crowded
airports
can
increase
a
newborn
s
risk
of
catching
an
infectious
disease

Should
my
baby
sit
on
my
lap
during
the
flight

Ideally
no

The
Federal
Aviation
Administration
FAA
doesn
t
require
a
ticket
for
children
under
the
age
of
years

But
that
means
your
baby
will
be
on
your
lap

If
there
is
turbulence
or
worse
it
may
not
be
physically
possible
to
protect
your
baby
in
your
arms

Turbulence
is
the
number
one
cause
of
children
s
injuries
on
an
airplane

If
you
do
not
buy
a
ticket
for
your
child
you
may
want
to
ask
if
your
airline
will
let
you
use
an
empty
seat
where
you
can
install
a
car
seat
for
your
baby

If
your
airline
s
lap
baby
policy
allows
this
avoid
the
busiest
travel
days
and
times
to
increase
your
odds
of
finding
an
empty
seat
next
to
you

The
safest
way
for
baby
to
fly
The
safest
way
for
your
baby
to
fly
is
in
a
child
safety
restraint
an
FAA-approved
car
seat
or
airplane
harness
device

It
should
be
approved
for
your
child
s
age
and
size
and
installed
with
the
airplane
s
seat
belt

Booster
seats
cannot
be
used
on
airplanes
during
flight

Infants
weighing
less
than
pounds
should
be
buckled
into
a
rear-facing
car
seat
during
airplane
travel

Children
who
weigh
to
pounds
should
be
restrained
in
a
car
seat

They
should
not
be
switched
to
using
just
the
airplane
s
lap
belt
until
they
reach
at
least
pounds

There
is
an
FAA-approved
alternative
to
using
a
car
seat
on
an
airplane
called
the
Child
Aviation
Restraint
System
CARES
This
airplane
safety
harness
is
not
meant
for
infants
however

It
is
designed
for
use
by
toddlers
to
pounds
and
only
on
airplanes

Should
I
bring
our
car
seat
on
the
plane
with
us

Does
that
count
as
luggage

Car
seats
booster
seats
and
strollers
generally
don
t
count
as
luggage
but
policies
vary
by
airline
check
with
yours
before
flying

In
most
cases
they
can
be
checked
at
the
gate
where
the
risk
of
damage
may
be
lower
at
no
cost

Consider
packing
the
car
seat
in
a
protective
bag
or
box

If
your
baby
has
their
own
airplane
seat
bring
your
car
seat
with
you

Not
all
car
seats
are
certified
for
use
in
airplanes

Make
sure
a
label
on
the
car
seat
says
This
restraint
is
certified
for
use
in
motor
vehicles
and
aircraft

Which
seat
on
the
plane
is
best
for
a
baby

Look
for
rows
on
the
plane
with
more
space
like
the
bulkhead

Exit
rows
are
out
for
safety
reasons

Choose
a
seat
closer
to
the
window
if
possible

Aisle
seats
can
be
risky
for
babies
during
beverage
service

Hot
drinks
being
passed
to
passengers
can
spill
and
cause
burns
and
their
little
arms
and
legs
can
be
caught
by
passing
carts

Aisle
seats
are
also
closer
to
falling
overhead
bin
items

If
you
use
a
car
seat
most
airlines
require
that
they
be
installed
in
a
window
seat

Ensure
that
your
baby
s
seat
is
next
to
you
on

plane

Visit
the
U
S
Department
of
Transportation
Airline
Family
Seating
Dashboard
for
tips

It
shows
which
airlines
guarantee
adjacent
seats
for
children
under
age
traveling
with
an
adult
at
no
extra
fee

Is
there
a
way
my
baby
can
lie
down
flat
on
long
flights

Buckling
your
baby
into
a
car
seat
or
safety
restraint
remains
the
safest
option

However
there
are
other
options
available
to
help
baby
sleep
comfortably
especially
on
long-haul
flights

Airline
bassinets

Some
airlines
offer
airline
bassinets
attached
to
the
plane
s
bulkhead
wall
the
wall
behind
the
galley
or
toilets
or
another
cabin

In
some
premium
cabins
they
can
be
built
into
the
seat
compartment
to
use
in
bulkhead
rows

Most
airline
bassinets
require
the
baby
to
be
under
months
old
and
or
pounds
and
not
yet
able
to
sit
up
unassisted

These
bassinets
are
sometimes
called
skycots
or
baskets

Sleeper
seat

For
an
added
fee
some
international
airlines
let
you
book
three
seats
in
a
row
with
locking
seat
extensions

This
creates
a
sky
couch
or
sleeper-seat
big
enough
for
both
parent
and
child

Some
airlines
also
offer
lie-flat
and
flat-bed
seats

Inflatable
seat
extenders

Some
airlines
let
you
bring
your
own
inflatable
individual
seat
extension
for
your
baby
to
snooze
on
lying
down

Not
all
airlines
permit
these
to
be
used
though
so
check
ahead
of
time

Your
child
will
need
their
own
seat
to
use
one

Note
For
all
options
above
your
baby
would
still
need
to
be
buckled
into
a
car
seat
or
held
on
your
lap
during
takeoff
turbulence
and
landing

Safe
sleep
practices
still
apply
on
the
airplane

If
your
baby
sleeps
on
your
lap
during
the
flight
stay
alert
and
check
on
your
baby
often

Make
sure
they
can
breathe
easily
and
their
face
is
uncovered

If
your
baby
sleeps
on
another
device
during
the
flight
check
that
it
is
firm
and
flat
with
no
soft
bedding

Your
Sleeping
Baby
Safe

Will
I
be
able
to
get
liquid
formula
or
expressed
breast
milk
through
security

Yes
but
you
have
to
follow
the
reasonable
quantities
rules

This
means
you
re
exempt
from
the
-
-
rule
limiting
liquids
to
ounces
mL
Pack
formula
expressed
breastmilk
or
water
for
mixing
with
powder
separately
and
be
ready
to
let
the
TSA
know
you
have
it

You
may
ask
that
they
not
go
through
the
x-ray
machine
although
this
shouldn
t
cause
a
health
problem
Visit
the
TSA
website
for

Any
tips
for
keeping
my
baby
comfortable
and
content
on
the
plane

Dress
your
baby
in
layers

The
temperature
in
a
plane
can
vary
widely
especially
if
you
are
stuck
waiting
on
a
runway

So
dress
your
baby
in
layers
of
clothing

As
you
pick
out
clothing
choose
outfits
that
make
diaper
changing
in
a
small
space
easier

Also
pack
a
change
of
clothes
or
two
in
case
turbulence
hits
during
a
diaper
change
or
when
you
are
feeding

Bring
plastic
bags
for
soiled
clothing

Be
ready
for
ear
pain
during
take-off
and
landing

During
takeoff
and
landing
changes
in
pressure
between
the
outer
ear
and
middle
ear
can
cause
discomfort

If
your
baby
has
had
ear
surgery
or
an
ear
infection
in
the
past
two
weeks
ask
their
doctor
if
it
s
OK
to
fly

Having
babies
drink
from
the
breast
or
a
bottle
or
suck
on
a
pacifier
can
help

If
your
child
has
a
cold
or
ear
infection
a
dose
of
acetaminophen
or
ibuprofen
may
help
check
with
your
doctor
for
the
right
amount
to
give
your
child

Reduce
jet
engine
noise
exposure

Airplane
cabin
noise
hovers
around
decibels
and
is
even
louder
during
takeoff

Using
cotton
balls
small
earplugs
or
noise-canceling
headphones
may
help
to
decrease
the
decibel
level
your
baby
is
exposed
to
and
also
make
it
easier
for
them
to
sleep
or
relax

Keep
in
mind
that
sleeping
babies
are
easier
for
everyone

If
possible
travel
at
a
time
when
your
baby
naturally
sleeps

Or
onsider
trying
to
put
off
a
nap
until
it
s
time
to
fly

Flight
delays
can
cause
this
to
backfire
if
your
exhausted
baby
decides
to
scream
instead
of
sleep

But
it
may
be
worth
a
try

Do
not
use
diphenhydramine
or
Benadryl
to
help
your
baby
sleep
without
talking
to
your
doctor

This
medication
can
have
serious
side
effects
especially
if
repeated
doses
are
given
on
long
flights

If
you
get
the
go-ahead
and
appropriate
dose
from
your
doctor
try
it
at
home
first

Some
children
react
to
the
medicine
by
getting
more
awake
instead
of
sleepy

Consider
a
diaper
change
right
before
boarding
the
plane

A
dry
baby
is
a
happy
baby

Fortunately
when
you
do
need
to
change
a
diaper
in-flight
many
planes
have
restroom
changing
tables

If
yours
doesn
t
ask
a
flight
attendant
if
there
is
a
spot
where
you
can
spread
out
your
changing
pad

Some
parents
resort
to
diaper-changing
on
the
closed
toilet
seat

If
you
try
this
be
sure
to
have
a
hand
on
your
baby
at
all
times
and
pack
a
disposable
changing
pad

Plan
for
delays
pack
plenty
of
supplies

Bring
distractions

Pack
some
toys
and
books
and
be
ready
to
play
with
your
baby
the
entire
time

A
tablet
with
videos
can
be
a
good
backup
if
the
toys
and
books
aren
t
helping
anymore
we
don
t
encourage
entertainment
media
for
children
under
the
age
of
but
desperate
times
can
sometimes
call
for
desperate
measures
Don
t
let
the
glares
get
to
you

Despite
the
best
advanced
planning
and
efforts
babies
cry
sometimes

Know
that
you
did
and
are
doing
all
you
can

At
that
point
one
of
the
best
ways
you
can
calm
your
baby
may
be
to
stay
calm
yourself

And
remember
that
for
every
person
who
is
glaring
at
you
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
have
been
through
it
themselves
and
have
lots
of
sympathy

Ask
for
help

Arrange
for
your
airline
to
help
you
if
you
need
help
making
a
connecting
flight

Carrying
a
child
safety
restraint
your
baby
and
luggage
through
a
busy
airport
can
be
challenging

Does
my
baby
need
a
passport
for
international
travel

Yes

All
U
S
citizens
including
infants
need
a
current
passport
to
travel
internationally

Parents
or
guardians
need
to
apply
with
their
baby
in
person
using
the
form
DS-

Be
sure
to
bring
your
baby
s
birth
certificate
and
a
photo
taken
within
the
last
months

Passport
photos
must
be
taken
with
nobody
else
in
the
photo
which
can
be
tricky
with
infants

To
do
this
safely
if
your
baby
can
t
sit
up
yet
lay
them
on
their
back
on
a
plain
white
blanket
or
sheet
to
ensure
head
support
without
having
to
hold
them

Another
option
is
covering
a
car
seat
with
the
sheet
and
taking
a
picture
with
your
child
in
it

What
about
domestic
flights

A
valid
passport
is
usually
the
only
identification
your
baby
will
need
to
fly
on
a
domestic
flight
unless
you
need
to
show
proof
of
age
for
a
discounted
child
fare

Check
with
your
airline
before
you
leave

Note
Children
under
age
will
not
be
required
to
get
a
Real
ID

What
is
the
best
time
of
day
to
fly
with
a
baby

It
is
hard
to
say
whether
flying
during
the
day
or
night
with
a
baby
is
better

After
the
first
few
weeks
some
infants
may
sleep
more
reliably
at
nighttime
than
they
do
during
naptime
travel

If
you
and
your
baby
can
sleep
on
the
plane
a
late-night
flight
may
be
the
way
to
go

Plot
edit
After
being
used
in
a
guess
the
weight
contest
at
a
county
fair
orphaned
pig
Babe
is
brought
home
to
the
farm
of
the
contest
winner
Arthur
Hoggett

There
he
is
taken
in
by
Border
Collie
Fly
her
irascible
mate
Rex
and
their
puppies
and
befriends
a
duck
named
Ferdinand
who
wakes
people
by
crowing
like
a
rooster
every
morning
so
he
will
be
considered
useful
and
be
spared
from
being
eaten

Dismayed
when
the
Hoggetts
buy
an
alarm
clock
Ferdinand
persuades
Babe
to
help
him
get
rid
of
it

In
doing
so
they
wake
Duchess
the
Hoggetts
cat
and
wreck
the
house
in
the
ensuing
chaos

Rex
sternly
instructs
Babe
to
stay
away
from
Ferdinand
and
the
house

Seeing
Fly
saddened
when
her
puppies
are
put
up
for
sale
Babe
lets
her
adopt
him

With
the
Hoggett
s
relatives
visiting
for
Christmas
Hoggett
decides
against
choosing
Babe
for
Christmas
dinner
and
tells
his
wife
Esme
that
Babe
may
bring
a
prize
for
ham
at
the
next
county
fair

Ferdinand
s
love
interest
Rosanna
is
served
instead
prompting
Ferdinand
to
escape
the
farm

Babe
investigates
the
fields
where
he
witnesses
a
pair
of
sheep
rustlers
stealing
Hoggett
s
sheep
and
quickly
alerts
Fly
and
the
farmer
preventing
the
rustlers
from
taking
the
whole
flock

Impressed
after
seeing
Babe
sort
hens
separating
the
brown
from
the
white
ones
Hoggett
takes
him
to
try
and
herd
the
sheep

Encouraged
by
an
elderly
ewe
named
Maa
Babe
gets
the
sheep
to
cooperate
by
asking
nicely
but
Rex
perceives
Babe
s
actions
as
an
insult
to
sheepdogs

When
Fly
stands
up
for
Babe
Rex
attacks
and
injures
her
and
bites
Hoggett
s
hand
when
he
tries
to
intervene

Rex
is
subsequently
chained
to
the
dog
house
and
sedated
leaving
the
sheep
herding
job
to
Babe

One
morning
Babe
scares
off
a
trio
of
feral
dogs
attacking
the
sheep
but
Maa
is
mortally
injured
and
dies
as
a
result

Hoggett
thinking
Babe
was
responsible
prepares
to
shoot
him
but
Fly
finds
out
the
truth
from
the
other
sheep
and
distracts
Hoggett
long
enough
for
Esme
to
inform
him
about
the
dogs
attacks
on
neighboring
farms

When
Esme
leaves
on
a
trip
Hoggett
signs
Babe
up
for
a
local
sheep
herding
competition

As
it
is
raining
the
night
before
Hoggett
lets
him
and
Fly
into
the
house
where
he
is
scratched
by
Duchess
who
in
turn
is
temporarily
confined
outside
as
punishment

When
she
is
let
back
in
later
she
gets
revenge
on
Babe
by
revealing
that
humans
consume
pigs

After
learning
from
Fly
that
this
is
true
Babe
runs
away
and
Rex
finds
him
the
next
morning
in
a
cemetery

Hoggett
brings
a
demoralized
Babe
home
where
he
refuses
to
eat

Hoggett
feeds
him
from
a
baby
bottle
sings
If
I
Had
Words
and
dances
a
jig
for
him
restoring
Babe
s
faith
in
Hoggett
s
affection

At
the
competition
Babe
meets
the
sheep
that
he
will
be
herding
but
they
ignore
his
attempts
to
speak
to
them

As
Hoggett
is
criticized
by
the
bemused
judges
and
ridiculed
by
the
public
for
using
a
pig
instead
of
a
dog
Rex
runs
back
to
the
farm
to
ask
the
sheep
what
to
do

After
promising
he
will
treat
them
better
from
now
on
the
sheep
disclose
to
him
a
secret
password

He
returns
in
time
to
convey
the
password
to
Babe
and
the
sheep
now
follow
his
instructions
flawlessly

Amid
the
crowd
s
acclamation
Babe
is
unanimously
given
a
perfect
score

When
Babe
sits
down
next
to
the
farmer
Hoggett
praises
him
with
the
standard
command
to
sheep
dogs
that
their
job
is
done
That
ll
do
Pig

That

Production
edit
Babe
is
an
adaptation
of
Dick
King-Smith
s
novel
The
Sheep-Pig
also
known
as
Babe
The
Gallant
Pig
in
the
US
which
tells
the
story
of
a
pig
raised
as
livestock
who
wants
to
do
the
work
of
a
sheepdog

The
main
animal
characters
are
played
by
a
combination
of
real
and
animatronic
pigs
and
Border
Collies

The
breed
of
pig
used
was
a
Large
White
which
grows
rapidly

On
account
of
this
piglets
of
the
required
size
were
used
during
the
course
of
the
filming
as
well
as
the
animatronic
model
for
visual
effects

The
film
is
divided
into
six
chapters
to
preserve
the
storybook-like
feel
of
the
original
novel
although
none
of
the
film
s
chapters
are
the
same
as
the
book
s
The
film
s
mice
characters
were
subsequently
added
to
read
the
chapter
titles
aloud
after
a
test
screening
in
which
producer
George
Miller
noted
that
younger
audiences
had
trouble
reading
them
needing
help
from
the
adults

After
seven
years
of
development
Babe
was
filmed
in
Robertson
New
South
Wales
Australia

The
talking-animal
visual
effects
were
done
by
Rhythm
Hues
Studios
R
H
Animal
Logic
and
Jim
Henson
s
Creature
Shop

According
to
actor
James
Cromwell
there
was
tension
on
the
set
between
producer
George
Miller
and
director
Chris
Noonan

Noonan
later
complained
I
don
t
want
to
make
a
lifelong
enemy
of
George
Miller
but
I
thought
that
he
tried
to
take
credit
for
Babe
tried
to
exclude
me
from
any
credit
and
it
made
me
very
insecure

It
was
like
your
guru
has
told
you
that
you
are
no
good
and
that
is
really
disconcerting

Miller
shot
back
Chris
said
something
that
is
defamatory
that
I
took
his
name
off
the
credits
on
internet
sites
which
is
just
absolutely
untrue

You
know
I
m
sorry
but
I
really
have
a
lot
more
to
do
with
my
life
than
worry
about
that

when
it
comes
to
Babe
the
vision
was
handed
to
Chris
on
a
plate

Interviewed
about
the
movie
in
Cromwell
admitted
he
nearly
turned
it
down
as
his
character
only
had
about
lines

He
was
persuaded
by
his
friend
Charles
Keating
to
take
it
anyway

Keating
told
him
it
s
a
free
ticket
to
Australia
and
if
the
movie
tanks
it
s
not
your
fault
it
s
the
pig
s
fault

Cromwell
said
Noonan
wanted
him
for
the
part
and
won
out
over
Miller
who
had
wanted
to
cast
an
Australian
actor

Cromwell
s
fee
was
around

He
asked
for
an
increase
when
he
realised
the
movie
was
making
millions
of
dollars
but
was
turned
down

Nevertheless
he
said
I
got
a
lot
out
of
that
film
and
it
turned
my
whole
life
around

I
didn
t
have
to
audition
anymore

In
a
sequel
directed
by
Miller
Babe
Pig
in
the
City
was
released
but
it
failed
to
achieve
the
same
success
as
the
first
film

In
a
video
game
based
on
the
original
film
was
published
by
Mastertronic
Group
for
the
PlayStation
Music
edit
The
musical
score
for
Babe
was
composed
by
Nigel
Westlake
and
performed
by
the
Melbourne
Symphony
Orchestra

Classical
orchestral
music
by
-century
French
composers
is
used
throughout
the
film
but
is
disguised
in
a
variety
of
ways
and
often
integrated
by
Westlake
into
his
score

The
theme
song
If
I
Had
Words
lyrics
by
Jonathan
Hodge
sung
by
Hoggett
near
the
film
s
conclusion
is
an
adaptation
of
the
Maestoso
final
movement
of
the
Organ
Symphony
by
Camille
Saint-Saëns
and
was
originally
performed
in
by
Scott
Fitzgerald
and
Yvonne
Keeley

This
tune
also
recurs
throughout
the
film
s
score

There
are
also
brief
quotations
within
the
score
from
Edvard
Grieg
s
Lyric
Pieces
Op

No

Other
music
featured
is
by
Léo
Delibes
Richard
Rodgers
Gabriel
Fauré

It
was

in

behind

acclaim
and

The

The
rare
family-friendly
feature
with
a
heart
as
big
as
its
special
effects
budget
Babe
offers
timeless
entertainment
for
viewers
of
all
ages

Metacritic
gave
the
film
a
score
of
based
on
reviews
indicating
universal
acclaim
Because
of
its
subject
being
a
piglet
Babe
was
initially
banned
from
Malaysia
in
order
to
avoid
upsetting
or
annoying
Muslims
who
view
pigs
as
haram
The
ruling
was
overturned
almost
a
year
later
and
the
film
was
released
direct-to-video

When
Babe
was
released
in
the
US
it
is
reported
that
activists
around
the
country
staked
out
movie
theaters
with
flyers
documenting
the
real-life
abuses
of
pigs
The
film
had
a
marked
effect
on
the
growth
of
vegetarianism
particularly
among
the
young

It
also
promoted
a
more
sympathetic
view
of
the
intellectual
emotional
and
social
capacities
of
animals

James
Cromwell
became
an
ethical
vegetarian
as
a
result
of
starring
as
Farmer
Hoggett
saying
I
decided
that
to
be
able
to
talk
about
this
movie
with
conviction
I
needed
to
become
a
vegetarian

In
he
went
on
to
organize
a
vegetarian
dinner
for
the
Los
Angeles
homeless
at
a
Compassionate
Christmas
event
in
order
to
reverse
the
barnyard
view
that
Christmas
is
carnage

Hi

My
name
is
Stephanie
and
I
m
a
vegan
foodie
from
the
beautiful
country
of
Canada

I
ve
been
vegan
for
years
now
and
couldn
t
imagine
my
life
any
other
way

I
started
my
food
blog
in
on
Instagram
and
TikTok
as
a
way
to
showcase
how
amazing
a
vegan
lifestyle
can
be

I
have
a
passion
for
plant
based
nutrition
and
creating
healthy
yet
delicious
plant
based
recipes

My
mission
is
to
share
this
beautiful
lifestyle
with
you

My
Story
Growing
up
I
ate
a
conventional
clean
diet
but
was
sucked
into
diet
culture
yoyo-ing
up
and
down
with
my
weight

I
restricted
calories
never
felt
satisfied
and
struggled
with
binge
eating
and
fear
of
food

I
thought
carbs
were
the
enemy
and
that
I
had
to
eat
egg
whites
chicken
and
veggies
all
day
to
be
healthy

This
all
changed
one
day
when
I
came
across
a
speech
by
Gary
Yourofsky
that
changed
my
life

I
instantly
lost
my
appetite
and
began
to
research
a
plant
based
diet

I
was
shocked
by
all
the
information
I
came
across
about
the
agriculture
industry
and
I
went
vegan
that
day

I
delved
into
learning
all
bout
plant
based
nutrition
and
learned
that
carbs
were
not
the
enemy
and
that
you
can
eat
whole
plant
foods
in
abundance
and
still
maintain
a
healthy
body
weight

I
quickly
realized
that
a
plant
based
diet
was
not
a
diet
but
a
lifestyle

And
this
lifestyle
was
full
of
abundance
fresh
food
and
nourishment

Although
this
didn
t
happen
overnight
my
mindset
gradually
began
to
shift
and
I
started
to
look
at
food
as
fuel
for
my
body

My
relationship
with
food
started
to
change
my
energy
levels
went
through
the
roof
and
I
was
feeling
better
than
I
ever
had
in
my
life

It
was
around
this
time
that
I
began
to
start
weightlifting
seriously
as
I
finally
had
the
energy
to
stick
to
a
workout
routine

Veganism
changed
my
life
in
so
many
ways

It
has
brought
so
much
joy
into
my
life
and
with
the
knowledge
I
have
accumulated
over
the
years
I
feel
obliged
to
share
everything
I
have
learned

That
is
why
I
have
created
this
space
to
help
you
achieve
a
lifestyle
full
of
abundance
balance
and
a
love
for
food

My
Philosophy
I
believe
that
we
feel
our
best
when
we
fuel
our
body
with
fresh
natural
living
unprocessed
foods

Health
and
wellbeing
come
from
within
and
food
is
your
medicine

I
strongly
believe
that
humans
thrive
off
of
eating
a
whole
foods
plant
based
diet
rich
in
fruits
vegetables
nuts
seeds
and
legumes

It
is
completely
possible
to
thrive
without
the
consumption
of
animal
products
and
we
can
actually
lead
healthier
lives
without
them

By
cutting
out
animal
products
and
ultra
processed
foods
our
taste
buds
change
our
bodies
change
and
we
start
to
crave
nutrient
dense
foods
instead

But
like
all
good
things
in
life
this
does
not
happen
overnight

What
I
promote
is
a
diet
rich
in
nutrient
dense
plant
foods
with
a
healthy
balance
of
carbs
protein
and
fats

Hints
At

Fans
Have
THOUGHTS
On
Who
It
s
About
by

Twitter
She
s
known
for
hiding
references
to
her
personal
life
in
her
work
but
in
the
case
of
her
latest
song
there
are
more
questions
than
answers

The
biggest
being
Who
is
Taylor
Swift
s
new
song
Babe
about

On
Friday
the
artist
released
the
new
track
with
Sugarland
which
heavily
hints
at
cheating

Although
new
isn
t
exactly
the
right
word
for
it

Because
of
when
it
was
written
the
potential
culprits
for
the
song
s
subject
include
Jake
Gyllenhaal
and
Conor
Kennedy
and
beyond
according
to
fans
speculation
on
Twitter

And
since
Swift
hasn
t
gone
on
the
record
about
her
inspiration
it
s
up
to
listeners
to
decide
for
themselves
who
she
s
talking
about
with
lyrics
like
Since
you
admitted
it
I
keep
picturing
her
lips
on
your
neck
I
can
t
unsee
it
I
hate
that
because
of
you
I
can
t
love
you
babe

So
get
out
your
big
magnifying
glass
like
the
pop-culture
detective
that
you
are
and
crack
this
case

Babe
was
written
by
Swift
and
Patrick
Monahan
of
Train
and
the
Reputation
singer
is
featured
in
the
chorus
but
the
country
duo
wasn
t
the
track
s
first
stop

ET
Canada
reported
that
Swift
and
Monahan
initially
created
the
collaboration
for
the
singer
s
fourth
album
Red
but
that
it
didn
t
end
up
making
the
cut

And
since
Red
came
out
in
October
that
helps
place
Babe
in
time

The
singer
had
released
Speak
Now
two
years
prior
so
that
gives
a
small
window
between
the
end
of
and
probably
mid-
in
which
she
was
likely
writing
songs
for
the
next
album

IFrame
During
that
time
Swift
had
two
public
relationships
with
Gyllenhaal
whom
Billboard
claims
she
dated
from
October
to
January
and
with
Conor
Kennedy
whom
she
was
linked
to
from
July
to
October
of

It
s
worth
pointing
out
that
with
lines
like
You
really
blew
this
babe
We
ain
t
getting
through
this
one
babe
This
is
the
last
time
I
ll
ever
call
you
babe
the
lyrics
are
vague
enough
that
the
song
could
easily
be
about
a
more
universal
experience
and
not
Swift
s
own
life

However
an
interview
that
Monahan
gave
to
ABC
News
Radio
back
in
seems
to
suggest
that
his
young
collaborator
was
drawing
on
something
more
personal
for
Babe

As
the
Train
singer
told
the
interviewer
It
s
her
song
I
was
just
lucky
enough
to
be
a
part
of
it
with
her

I
m
not
going
through
different
relationships
and
breakups
and
all
the
stuff
that
young
people
do
so
her
perspective
is
very
fresh

So
it
does
seem
like
the
subject
is
someone
from
Swift
s
history
an
assumption
supported
by
the
fact
that
Gyllenhaal
and
Kennedy
are
both
believed
to
be
referred
to
in
other
songs
on
Red

Vulture
speculated
in
that
a
whopping
three
songs
from
Red
could
be
about
Kennedy
and
Begin
Again
was
rumored
by
CBS
News
to
be
about
the
Hyannis
Port
native
as
well

In
it
she
compares
her
current
good
boyfriend
to
her
last
less
impressive
one
and
many
interpreted
the
men
as
Kennedy
and
Gyllenhaal
respectively

Plus
in
an
interview
for
Good
Morning
America
promoting
Begin
Again
Swift
explained
the
song
s
meaning
back
in
It
s
about
when
you
ve
gotten
through
a
really
bad
relationship
and
you
finally
dust
yourself
off
and
go
on
that
first
date
after
a
horrible
breakup
and
the
vulnerability
that
goes
along
with
all
that

With
that
statement
which
suggests
Swift
s
relationship
with
Gyllenhaal
was
not
necessarily
her
best
all
signs
seem
to
point
his
way

And
indeed
fans
have
speculated
that
Babe
is
about
the
Oscar-nominated
actor
as
well

When
one
fan
asked
her
followers
who
they
thought
the
song
was
about
they
were
quick
to
throw
out
Gyllenhaal
s
name
indicating
what
they
claimed
were
connections
between
this
new
song
and
others
previously
linked
to
the
-year-old

Even
though
it
s
been
six
years
her
devoted
fans
still
have
her
back
unleashing
fiery
tirades
against
the
Donnie
Darko
star
online

They
re
convinced
they
know
what
happened
and
they
re
not
letting
the
actor
off
the
hook

Obviously
there
s
no
confirmation
yet
but
as
you
can
see
fans
are
pretty
confident
they
ve
cracked
Swift
s
code
on
this
latest
song

They
fully
believe
that
Babe
is
about
Gyllenhaal
cheating
and
as
far
as
they
re
concerned
the
Nightcrawler
star
may
have
some
splainin
to
do

What
Does
Babe
Mean
From
a
Guy

When
a
guy
uses
the
term
babe
to
refer
to
someone
it
could
imply
different
things

It
could
signify
a
compliment
to
their
appearance
or
a
way
of
appreciating
their
exceptional
ability

Alternatively
it
could
be
a
flirty
hint
that
he
likes
them

Here
are
some
possible
reasons
why
a
guy
might
use
babe
towards
someone
He
admires
their
appearance
If
a
guy
says
babe
to
someone
it
could
be
a
compliment
directed
towards
their
appearance

He
might
use
this
term
when
they
re
looking
particularly
attractive
or
when
they
ve
put
effort
into
their
outfit
hair
or
makeup

He
acknowledges
their
accomplishments
A
guy
might
use

praise
them
for
giving
an
amazing
work
presentation
or
winning

challenging
sports

At
times

with
someone

them
in
a
fun
or
flirtatious
manner

interest

is
hinting

If

Ttmn
Mean

Meaning
Uses
and
More
If
a
guy
said
babe
to
someone
and
they
re
trying
to
figure
out
what
he
meant
here
are
a
couple
of
things
to
consider
Consider
the
context
of
the
conversation

Did
he
say
it
in
response
to
something
they
said
or
did

Was
it
sent
out
of
the
blue

Think
about
the
relationship
they
have
with
this
guy

Are
they
friends
dating
or
in
a
relationship

Pay
attention
to
his
body
language
and
tone
of
voice

Does
he
seem
serious
playful
or
sarcastic

Of
course
it
is
entirely
possible
that
he
is
using
babe
casually
without
intending
it
in
any
specific
way

If
they
re
still
unsure
they
can
always
ask
him
what
he
meant
by
it

Example
Guy
Hey
babe
can
you
pick
up
some
groceries
on
your
way
home

Guy
Sure
thing
babe

Anything
specific
you
need

Guy
That

amazing
babe

I
can
t
wait

was
a

professional

and

League
NHL

Boston
Bruins
and

He

and
was
a
member

the
famous
S

and
another
with

Rangers
in

A
physical
forward
known
for
his
fighting
ability
while
with
the
Maroons
and
Rangers
an
apparent
decline
in
his
play
was
reversed
when
he
switched
to
defence
after
he
was
traded
to
the

was

three
times
after

as

most
valuable

upon

He
never

as
he

The
league
organized
an
all-star
benefit
game
that
raised
for
Siebert
s
family

He
was
inducted
into
the
Hockey
Hall
of
Fame
in

Early
life
edit
Born
in
Plattsville
Ontario
Siebert
grew
up
in
the
nearby
community
of
Zurich
located
on
the
eastern
shores
of
Lake
Huron

He
became
obsessed
with
hockey
at
an
early
age
playing
the
game
nearly
every
day

He
played
intermediate
hockey
in
Zurich
and
Exeter
before
moving
to
Kitchener
to
play
junior
hockey

Though
his
elder
brothers
mocked
his
simple
playing
style
he
used
his
size
and
strength
to
push
his
way
through
opponents
Siebert
was
invited
to
join
the
Kitchener
Greenshirts
in

He
won
the
Ontario
Hockey
Association
OHA
and
eastern
Canadian
junior
championships
with
Kitchener
in
but
lost
the
Memorial
Cup
final
to
the
University
of
Manitoba

After
a
year
of
senior
hockey
in
Kitchener
he
moved
on
to
the
Niagara
Falls
Cataracts
winning
the
OHA
senior
championship
in

Professional
career
edit
Siebert
was
signed
by
the
Montreal
Maroons
in
and
made
his
professional
debut
that
same
year

He
finished
second
on
the
team
with
goals
as
the
Maroons
finished
second
in
the
NHL
standings

Montreal
defeated
the
Pittsburgh
Pirates
and
Ottawa
Senators
in
the
playoffs
to
win
the
NHL
championship

Siebert
scored
three
points
in
the
Stanley
Cup
Finals
as
the
Maroons
defeated
the
Western
Hockey
League
champion
Victoria
Cougars
to
win
the
Stanley
Cup

When
Hooley
Smith
arrived
in
Montreal
in
Siebert
was
paired
with
Smith
and
Nels
Stewart

The
trio
were
known
as
the
S
Line
and
emerged
as
one
of
the
top
scoring
lines
in
the
NHL

Stewart
was
the
goal
scorer
on
the
line
while
Smith
set
him
up
with
his
passing
game
but
it
was
Siebert
who
used
his
strength
and
speed
to
move
the
puck
out
of
their
defensive
zone
and
to
create
space
for
his
line
mates

His
physical
style
of
play
occasionally
resulted
in
Siebert
being
brought
in
front
of
league
president
Frank
Calder
for
supplementary
discipline
as
in
December
when
he
was
suspended
for
a
time
following
a
violent
melee
with
Billy
Boucher
of
the
New
York
Americans

When
Boucher
responded
to
an
elbow
by
slashing
Siebert
over
the
head
the
latter
player
responded
with
repeated
wild
swings
of
his
own
stick
at
Boucher
injuring
him

Siebert
s
best
offensive
season
came
in
when
he
finished
eighth
in
league
scoring
with
points

It
proved
to
be
his
last
season
with
the
Maroons
as
the
team
was
struggling
financially
and
chose
to
sell
him
to
the
New
York
Rangers
for
cash

He
went
on
to
win
his
second
Stanley
Cup
that
year

He
struggled
offensively
for
much
of
the
season
however
and
it
was
rumoured
he
would
be
traded

The
trade
finally
happened
early
in
the
season
as
he
was
sent
to
the
Boston
Bruins
in
exchange
for
Vic
Ripley
and
Roy
Burmeister

The
deal
reunited
Siebert
with
former
S
Line
member
Nels
Stewart

After
Eddie
Shore
was
suspended
for
his
assault
on
Ace
Bailey
Bruins
coach
Art
Ross
shifted
Siebert
from
left
wing
to
defence

The
switch
rejuvenated
his
career
he
enjoyed
a
comeback
season
in

Frequently
remaining
on
the
ice
for
entire
games
as
one
of
Boston
s
key
players
Siebert
earned
five
votes
in
a
Associated
Press
poll
naming
the
top
comeback
player
in
sport
for
that
year

He
later
scoffed
at
the
legend
of
his
comeback
in
Boston
stating
that
he
never
lost
his
ability
to
play
at
the
same
level
he
did
with
the
Maroons
instead
blaming
Lester
Patrick
for
improperly
utilizing
him
in
New
York

While
Shore
and
Siebert
were
an
effective
pairing
on
defence
tensions
between
the
two
were
evident

They
shared
a
violent
feud
when
they
were
opponents
and
never
spoke
a
word
to
the
other
as
teammates

Though
he
was
named
a
first
team
all-star
in
the
Bruins
decided
Siebert
s
career
was
in
decline
and
chose
to
trade
him
to
the
Montreal
Canadiens
along
with
Roger
Jenkins
in
exchange
for
Leroy
Goldsworthy
Sammy
McManus
and
cash
following
the
season

He
was
immediately
named
the
team
s
captain
a
position
he
retained
until
his
retirement

In
his
first
season
with
the
Canadiens
Siebert
earned
his
second
all-star
selection
and
won
the
Hart
Trophy
as
the
most
valuable
player
in
the
NHL

He
earned
his
third
consecutive
all-star
selection
in

Plagued
by
injuries
in
his
final
season
Siebert
announced
his
retirement
in
to
become
the
head
coach
of
the
Canadiens

Death
and
family
edit
Siebert
never
had
the
opportunity
to
take
up
his
new
post

On
August
while
vacationing
with
his
family
and
swimming
with
his
daughters
at
Lake
Huron
he
drowned
attempting
to
retrieve
an
inflatable
tire
they
were
playing
with

Shocked
by
the
news
Siebert
s
peers
lauded
his
character
and
play
indicating
that
his
death
was
a
considerable
loss
to
the
game
of
hockey

Among
them
his
former
manager
with
the
Maroons
Tommy
Gorman
remarked
that
Siebert
was
popular
with
his
fellow
players
and
was
a
great
defenceman
who
lost
fairly
and
won
modestly
At
the
time
of
his
death
Siebert
was
visiting
his
cottage
to
celebrate
the
birthday
of
his
father
William

He
cherished
the
time
he
had
with
his
two
daughters
Judy
and
Joan
who
were
and
years
old
respectively
when
they
witnessed
his
drowning

His
loss
represented
a
significant
financial
burden
for
his
family
as
he
spent
nearly
all
of
his
income
paying
for
his
paraplegic
wife
s
medical
costs

The
league
organized
an
all-star
benefit
game
to
aid
Siebert
s
widow
with
the
goal
of
raising

It
was
the
third
such
benefit
game
in
NHL
history

The
Montreal
Canadiens
faced
an
all-star
team
composed
of
the
best
players
from
the
remaining
teams

The
all-stars
defeated
the
Canadiens
in
the
game
held
on
October

Though
organizers
were
disappointed
with
the
attendance
of
just
fans
they
met
their
target

A
physical
player
and
fighter
on
the
ice
Siebert
was
a
soft-spoken
family
man
off
it

He
was
especially
faithful
to
his
wife
Bernice
who
was
left
a
paraplegic
following

wife
to
her

he

what
is
the
first

comes
into
your

Fine-ass

Us
too

Of
course
there
are
girls
boys
and
non-binary
individuals
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
on
this
diverse
platform
but
for
us
there
is
nothing
better
than
a
youthful-looking
firm-bodied
girl
who
is
curvy
in
all
the
right
places

Even
better
if
she
has
a
pretty
face
and
takes
care
of
herself
with
nice
clothes
nails
and
hair

In
our
list
of
the
top
ten
babes
on
OnlyFans
we
have
listed
ten
of
the
cutest
sultry
babes
we
could
find

Of
course
these
ten
are
only
the
tip
of
the
Only
Fans
babes
iceberg
but
our
list
will
certainly
give
you
a
starting
place

Please

About
The

thing

about
Charlotte
Lavish
is
her
huge
round
ass

We
are
talking
tiny
waist
big
firm
butt
and
thicc
thighs
for
days

She
is
fit
and
cute
with
long
black
hair
and
pretty
titties
and
she
loves
to
dance
around
in
body
con
dresses
and
tight-fitting
booty
shorts

There
is
a
reason
why
her
walk
aways
are
some
of
her
most
popular
clips

Charlotte
s

features
interracial

as

and

FAQ
s
About
OnlyFans
Babes
Does
OnlyFans
Affect
My
Credit
Score

No
OnlyFans
will
not
affect
your
credit
score

It
is
not
a
contractual
commitment
but
is
instead
an
optional
subscription
like
tv
or
music
streaming
sites
that
can
be
canceled
at
any
time

There
is
one
thing
to
keep
an
eye
on
though
as
although
subscription
payments
come
out
on
a
monthly
basis
if
you
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
random
babe
OnlyFans
content
in
addition
to
that
fee
getting
a
mortgage
or
bank
loan
may
be
more
difficult
depending
on
the
lender
as
it
may
be
treated
as
a
liability
like
gambling
would

This
is
of
course
very
uncommon
but
it
has
happened
in
a
few
occasions
due
to
hundreds
of
small
transactions
occurring
over
a
long
span
of
time

What
Was
OnlyFans
Originally
Made
For

The
site
was
originally
made
for
music
and
other
performers
to
provide
clips
and
photos
for
their
fans
to
purchase

They
could
provide
premium
exclusive
content
that
fans
could
not
find
elsewhere
giving
them
an
additional
revenue
stream

Over
time
adult
entertainers
found
the
platform
and
then
during
the
Covid
pandemic
in
the
site
exploded
with
new
users
as
stripers
sex
workers
and
models
found
themselves
working
from
home
like
everybody
else
was

It
became
the
safest
way
to
check
out
OnlyFans
babes
and
continues
to
grow
in
popularity
to
this
day

Do
OnlyFans
Models
Actually
Talk
to
You

Yes

In
most
cases
when
you
DM
babes
on
OnlyFans
it
is
actually
them
answering
back

Unfortunately
some
of
the
most
popular
girls
and
guys
on
the
platform
found
that
they
were
unable
to
keep
up
with
the
requests
and
chose
to
outsource
their
chatting
to
professional
chatters
who
are
hired
to
imitate
the
model
and
pretend
it
is
them

This
allows
the
content
creators
to
make
more
money
but
it
cheats
the
fans
out
of
a
genuinely
intimate
experience

Can
you
Get
Catfished
on
OnlyFans

Yes
it
is
possible
for
somebody
to
create
a
fake
OnlyFans
page
but
it
is
more
difficult
for
them
than
on
other
social
media
platforms
because
making
a
creator
page
involves
showing
your
photo
ID
sending
in
selfies
and
providing
your
real
name
address
and
bank
information

This
makes
it
risky
for
scammers
to
try
anything
as
if
they
are
reported
their
identity
is
known

What
are
the
Lowest
Paid
OnlyFans

The
lowest
amount
Only
Fans
babes
can
charge
for
a
monthly
subscription
to
their
page
is
per
month

They
can
also
set
up
tips
or
paid
private
message
services
that
start
at
a
minimum
of
That
said
if
a
person
makes
an
account
but
never
gets
any
subscribers
they
can
make
nothing
at
all

There
are
also
pages
that
are
free
to
subscribe
with
pay
per
view
content
available
if
the
fans
wish
to
buy
it

There
are
many
different
avenues
to
make
money
or
not
on
the
platform

Conclusion
We
don
t
know
about
you
but
we
are
sweating
after
checking
out
those
ten
Only
Fans
babes

From
naughty
Emma
Magnolia
and
her
spicy
daily
content
to
Charlotte
Lavish
s
oiled
up
booty
pics
we
have
enough
new
material
in
our
spank
bank
to
last
for
weeks

There
are
millions
of
creators
on
the
platform
so
if
these
girls
were
not
what
you
were
looking
for
do
not
fear

There
is
literally
something
out
there
for
everybody

OnlyFans
is
a
diverse
site
with
creators
who
get
to
show
off
their
bodies
and
make
cash
doing
it
while
fans
get
to
choose
to
pay
for
exactly
the
type
of
porn
they
most
enjoy
XXX
live
streams
nude
photos
and
services
like
dick
ratings
or
sexting

Pay
per
view
content
makes
it
even
easier
to
choose
the
type
of
content
you
most
want
to
see
like
selecting
sex
tapes
from
a
buffet
you
have
curated
by
subscribing

We
hope
that
we
were
able
to
help
you
on
your
journey
to
find
the
best
babes
on
OnlyFans

Make
sure
you
subscribe
to
the
girls
you
liked
and
send
them
a
fat
tip

Making
high-quality
content
is
not
easy

They
deserve
it

Nat
Fein
s
Pulitzer
Prize-winning
photograph
of
Ruth
two
months
before
his
death
In
Ruth
began
to
experience
severe
pain
over
his
left
eye
and
had
difficulty
swallowing

Results
from
tests
taken
at
French
Hospital
in
New
York
revealed
an
inoperable
malignant
tumor
at
the
base
of
his
skull

In
his
neck
doctors
identified
a
lesion
which
they
diagnosed
as
nasopharyngeal
carcinoma
or
lymphoepithelioma
a
type
of
throat
cancer

A
physician
who
reviewed
Ruth
s
autopsy
in
concluded
that
Ruth
s
lifelong
use
of
tobacco
probably
played
a
part
in
his
cancer

Treatments
over
the
next
eighteen
months
proved
to
be
ineffective
with
Ruth
slowly
and
notably
withering

He
was
initially
treated
with
painful
cancer
therapies
which
were
available
at
the
time
including
X-ray
therapy

He
was
also
injected
with
female
hormones

He
underwent
unsuccessful
surgery
to
remove
the
mass

Doctors
also
tried
a
new
treatment
called
chemotherapy
which
made
Ruth
one
of
the
first
cancer
patients
to
receive
sequential
radiation
and
chemotherapy

He
was
also
concurrently
given
experimental
drugs
which
initially
worked
with
his
health
temporarily
improving

However
the
remission
proved
to
be
temporary

Ruth
died
in
his
sleep
on
August
at
p
m
in
Memorial
Hospital
in
New
York
City
he
was
years
old

Reverend
Thomas
F
Kaufmann
gave
Ruth
the
last
sacrament
later
saying
The
Babe
died
a
beautiful
death

He
said
his
prayers
and
lapsed
into
a
sleep

He
died
in
his
sleep
Dr

Hayes
Martin
announced
Ruth
s
death
revealing
that
the
cause
of
death
was
cancer

Previously
only
his
family
had
known
Ruth
had
not
been
told
of
his
diagnosis

His
body
was
taken
from
the
hospital
to
the
Universal
Funeral
Chapel
and
his
family
allowed
mourners
to
visit
and
pay
their
respects
after
p
m
In
dentist
and
associate
professor
Dr
William
James
Maloney
of

died
of
nasopharyngeal
carcinoma

City
over

Yankee
Stadium
edit
Babe
Ruth
played
for
the
New
York
Yankees
from
to
and
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
greatest
baseball
players

He
starred
for
them
for
fifteen
years

After
his
death
thousands
of
fans
were
able
to
view
Ruth
s
body
as
he
lay
in
state
at
Yankee
Stadium

From
August
to
the
his
mahagony
casket
was
placed
in
the
stadium
lobby
which
was
situated
just
behind
home
plate

In
the
two
days
that
Ruth
was
displayed
in
an
open
casket
it
is
estimated
that
fans
came
to
file
past
his
casket

In
the
Montgomery
Advertiser
said
that
people
had
jammed
the
streets
to
wait
for
their
turn
to
come
into
Yankee
Stadium

People
also
traveled
from
other
states
to
pay
their
respects

After
the
wake
at
Yankee
Stadium
Ruth
s
body
was
moved
on
the
night
of
August
and
held
at
the
Universal
Funeral
Chapel

St

Patrick
s
Cathedral
edit
On
August
there
were
police
assigned
for
crowd
control
at
St

Patrick
s
Cathedral
where
a
service
for
Ruth
was
to
be
held

The
Brooklyn
Daily
Eagle
ran
the
headline
Brave
Rain
as
Rites
Are
Held
for
Babe
Ruth
on
August

There
was
a
service
for
Ruth
at
St

Patrick
s
Cathedral
and
the
majority
of
people
could
not
enter
the
church
so
they
waited
outside

The
funeral
procession
arrived
at
am
and
Ruth
was
carried
into
the
cathedral
in
a
mahogany
casket

Roughly
people
were
able
to
enter
the
cathedral
and
the
police
estimated
that
were
waiting
outside

The
Messenger
newspaper
reported
that
the
crowd
fell
silent
when
Ruth
s
body
was
taken
from
the
hearse

Only
the
noise
from
the
policemen
s
horses
walking
could
be
heard
and
people
looked
on
from
rooftops
and
from
the
windows
of
the
buildings
near
the
church

Also
attending
the
funeral
were
Leo
Durocher
manager
of
the
Brooklyn
Dodgers
Mel
Ott
right
fielder
of
the
New
York
Giants
and
Hank
Greenberg
former
first
baseman
and
outfielder
from
the
Detroit
Tigers

At
the
cathedral
Ruth
s
casket
was
placed
on
a
catafalque
which
was
surrounded
by
six
lit
candles

The
Archbishop
of
New
York
Cardinal
Francis
Spellman
delivered
the
requiem

Cardinal
Spellman
did
not
deliver
a
eulogy
but
he
said
a
special
prayer
asking
that
Ruth
s
memory
may
inspire
future
generations

The
text
of
his
speech
was
reported
by
The
Catholic
Advance
May
the
Divine
Spirit
that
inspired
Babe
Ruth
to
overcome
hardships
and
win
the
crucial
game
of
life
animate
many
generations
of
American
youth
to
learn
to
play
their
positions
on
all
American
teams
and
may
this
generous-hearted
soul
through
the
mercy
of
God
the
final
scoring
of
his
own
good
deeds
and
the
prayers
of
his
faithful
friends
rest
in
everlasting
peace

Amen

Buckle
up
parents

Your
baby
s
first
year
is
a
whirlwind
of
milestones

You
ve
already
seen
them
take
their
first
breath
heard
their
first
wail
and
changed
their
first
dirty
diaper

Only
a
couple
thousand
more
to
go
this
year
alone

So
what
s
up
next

Developmental
milestones
are
behaviors
and
physical
skills
children
reach
and
master
as
they
grow

Some
first-year-of-life
physical
milestones
include
rolling
over
reaching
for
objects
sitting
up
crawling
Behavioral
social
milestones
include
mimicking
your
expressions
and
crying
or
laughing
to
show
emotions

So
get
your
cameras
ready
here
are
the
milestones
you
can
expect
during
your
baby
s
magical
first
year
of
life

First
month
It
may
seem
that
your
baby
is
simply
an
eating
pooping
and
sleeping
machine
at
this
point

But
a
lot
is
going
on
in
that
tiny
body

Milestones
to
watch
for
include
bringing
hands
and
fists
toward
mouth
though
not
always
with
great
accuracy
developing
reflexes
flinching
at
loud
sounds
shutting
eyes
at
bright
lights
focusing
on
objects
brought
within
feet
of
their
face
turning
toward
familiar
sounds
and
voices
like
yours

Second
month
Your
baby
is
starting
to
act
well
more
baby-like

By
the
end
of
months
your
baby
is
likely
to
be
gurgling
cooing
trying
to
follow
movement
with
their
eyes
called
tracking
although
it
may
not
seem
very
coordinated
holding
their
head
up
and
pushing
upward
with
their
arms
while
lying
on
their
tummy
Third
month
Your
baby
is
progressing
from
dependent
newborn
to
more
independent
baby
yay
you
might
find
those
minutes
to
take
a
shower

This
is
when
some
of
that
cuteness
overload
starts
to
kick
in

Watch
for
smiling
at
the
sound
of
your
voice
pro
tip
record
this
and
review
in
years
to
prove
that
there
was
once
a
time
your
child
liked
you
holding
their
head
and
chest
up
and
kicking
their
legs
when
lying
on
their
stomach
grasping
toys
putting
their
hand
in
their
mouth
with
more
precision
making
more
vowel
sounds
ooh
and
ah
recognizing
familiar
faces
and
objects
from
a
distance
trying
to
imitate
your
facial
expressions
Fourth
month
At
this
stage
your
baby
is
taking
the
milestones
already
achieved
and
perfecting
them

For
example
they
may
hold
their
head
up
more
consistently
and
for
longer
periods
grasp
toys
with
more
coordination
and
copy
your
expressions
with
more
accuracy

Other
milestones
are
holding
a
rattle
and
shaking
it
at
the
same
time
perhaps
starting
to
roll
from
tummy
to
back
tracking
movement
more
fluidly
pushing
down
on
legs
when
held
in
standing
position
Fifth
month
Your
baby
continues
to
grow
explore
and
master

As
their
strength
and
coordination
increase
you
may
notice
that
your
baby
is
rolling
from
tummy
to
back
and
then
back
to
tummy
grabbing
their
feet
and
maybe
even
inserting
them
into
their
mouth
moving
objects
from
one
hand
to
another
showing
interest
in
the
food
you
re
eating
a
sign
they
re
getting
ready
for
solid
foods
Sixth
month
Your
baby
s
growing
up

They
may
now
be
sitting
up
briefly
without
any
support
saying
consonant
mmmm
and
vowel
eeee
ooooo
sounds
playing
and
expressing
displeasure
when
playtime
stops
keep
those
raspberries
coming

trying
to
get
things
out
of
reach
recognizing
their
name
expressing
emotion
by
crying
or
whining
when
sad
or
angry
and
laughing
or
squealing
when
happy
Given
that
they
are
now
getting
better
and
better
at
grasping
and
holding
objects
the
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
says
months
is
a
good
time
to
begin
to
encourage
your
baby
to
use
spoons
and
their
hands
to
feed
themselves

We
re
warning
you
It
won
t
be
pretty

You
can
even
introduce
a
sippy
cup
or
regular
cup
with
help

Seventh
month
Your
baby
continues
to
build
on
what
they
ve
already
learned

Milestones
include
sitting
up
without
support
for
longer
periods
responding
to
the
word
no
recognizing
emotions
happy
stern
etc

by
your
tone
using
their
hand
like
a
rake
to
reach
for
something
called
the
raking
grasp
responding
to
expressions
smiling
at
a
smiling
face
looking
uncertain
at
a
fearful
one
putting
objects
in
their
mouth
to
explore
them

tracking
objects
more
smoothly
stringing
more
consonants
together
while
babbling
Eighth
month
You
might
notice
that
your
little
one
can
now
roll
over
sit
up
and
move
objects
from
hand
to
hand
or
hand
to
mouth
like
a
pro

You
might
also
begin
to
see
your
baby
rocking
back
and
forth
on
their
hands
and
knees
or
scoot
along
the
floor
precursors
to

some
babies
will
be
cutting
their
first
teeth
around
this
age
continuing
to
babble
was
that
a
random
ma-ma
or
da-da
you
just
heard

developing
stranger
or
separation
anxiety
this
is
a
kind
of
distress
babies
feel
when
they
re
separated
from
their
parents
or
primary
caregivers
Don
t
worry
separation
anxiety
passes

We
promise
you
ll
eventually
be
able
to
go
to
the
bathroom
alone
again

Ninth
month
Your
baby
is
on
the
move

They
may
be
crawling
more
confidently
pulling
up
to
a
standing
position
playing
peekaboo
or
looking
for
an
object
you
ve
hidden
using
the
pincer
grip
which
involves
holding
a
small
object
like
a
piece
of
cereal
or
pasta
between
their
forefinger
and
thumb
pointing
at
things
they
want
Tenth
month
Your
baby
conintues
to
explore
and
experiment

Watch
your
baby
as
they
re
moving
from
pulling
to
stand
or
crawling
to
cruising
or
walking
while
holding
on
to
furniture
or
objects
around
a
room
banging
objects
together
just
to
hear
the
sound
they
make
a
kind
of
auditory
assault
rivaled
only
by
your
neighbor
s
garage
band
poking
at
things
putting
objects
into
a
container
and
then
taking
them
out
again
feeding
themselves
finger
foods
shaking
their
head
no
and
waving
bye-bye
Eleventh
month
In
addition
to
reaching
crawling
and
cruising
your
baby
may
be
continuing
to
explore
language
giving
you
more
mamas
dadas
and
maybe
even
the
occasional
uh-oh

using
the
right
inflection
understanding
simple
declaritive
statements
such
as
don
t
touch
copying
your
behaviors
like
pushing
buttons
on
a
play
phone
and
babbling
to
mimic
converation
Twelfth
month
Congratulations

You
officially
have
a
toddler
and
you
re
no
worse
for
wear
except
for
maybe
that
time
your
baby
gave
your
hoop
earring
that
really
bad
tug
and
well
we
digress

During
their
twelfth
month
your
baby
will
likely
be
cruising
standing
briefly
unsupported
and
maybe
even
taking
a
step
or
two
exploring
objects
by
banging
throwing
and
dropping
them
saying
one
or
two
simple
words
such
as
hi
no
and
bye
using
objects
correctly
if
not
clumsily
for
example
using
a
spoon
to
eat
and
a
comb
to
brush
hair
looking
to
the
right
object
when
you
say
Where
s
the
dog

or
Where
s
grandma

When
to
talk
with
your
pediatrician
While
most
babies
will
reach
milestones
at
roughly
and
roughly
is
the
operative
word
here
the
same
age
there
s
a
wide
range
of
normal

Your
sister
s
baby
walked
at
months
and
yours
is
still
crawling
at
months

Normal

Your
-month-old
baby
can
pick
up
Cheerios
like
a
vacuum
but
your
neighbor
s
baby
the
same
age
continues
to
struggle

Yep
that
s
normal
too

Babies
born
prematurely
or
with
a
health
issue
or
congenital
disorder
can
also
take
more
time
to
reach
milestones

And
one
study
found
that
girls
tend
to
reach
milestones
before
boys
although
the
differences
weren
t
huge
All
along
the
way
your
baby
s
pediatrician
will
be
looking
out
for
milestones
and
watching
your
baby
s
progress

If
your
baby
s
doctor
feels
there
s
a
need
for
intervention
screening
testing
or
therapies
for
example
they
ll
let
you
know

And
don
t
shrug
off
your
own
intuition

If
you
feel
something
needs
investigation
speak
up

Keep
your
well
baby
appointments
typically
to
in
the
first
year
and
see
them
as
an
opportunity
to
chat
with
your
pediatrician
about
what
s
going
on

The
takeaway
Remember
that
the
average
ages
for
reaching
certain
milestones
are
just
that
averages

Some
babies
will
do
things
earlier
while
others
will
do
them
later
and
that
s
all
usually
OK

In
fact
one
Swiss
study
published
in
found
that
children
who
started
walking
early
younger
than
the
study
s
average
of
months
were
neither
more
intelligent
nor
more
coordinated
by
their
late
teen
years
than
children
who
walked
later
the
latest
was
months
But
as
always
speak
to
your
child
s
doctor
if
you
have
any
concerns

Update
at

Henrico
Police
Chief
Eric
English
has
stated
there
is
no
evidence
that
a
former
nurse
accused
of
abusing
a
newborn
in
the
NICU
at
Henrico
Doctors
Hospital
targeted
children
based
on
their
race

The
statement
issued
on
Jan

addresses
allegations
circulating
on
social
media
and
in
some
news
reports
suggesting
racially
motivated
abuse
by
the
nurse

The
accused
-year-old
Erin
Elizabeth
Ann
Strotman
of
Chesterfield
County
has
faced
claims
of
targeting
Black
infants

However
Chief
English
emphasized
that
such
claims
are
not
factual
based
on
the
preliminary
findings
of
the
investigation
conducted
by

Police

The
statement
reads
Henrico
Police
is
aware

These
individuals
in
the
video
claim
the
victims
were
targeted
by
the
suspect
on
account
of
their
race

The
preliminary
investigation
indicates
this
information
is
not
factual

As

day
last

Henrico
County
Commonwealth
s
Attorney
Shannon
Taylor
shared
the
following
statement
about
the
investigation
First
my
thoughts
are
with
the
families
of
the
injured
children
who
suffered
harm
while
in
a
facility
designed
to
provide
comfort
and
care

I
would
also
echo
the
remarks
made
by
Chief
Eric
English
earlier
today
in
recognizing
the
dedicated
work
of
the
Henrico
Police
Division
and
Henrico
Child
Protective
Services
Department
of
Social
Services
as
well
as
the
staff
of
my
office

Furthermore
I
thank
both
the
Virginia
Department
of
Health
and
Virginia
State
Police
for
their
assistance

Investigation
Reveals
Disturbing
Pattern
As
the
investigation
progressed
both
local
police
and
Child
Protective
Services
CPS
became
involved

Surprisingly
CPS
had
previously
concluded
that
one
of
the
babies
Noah
Hackey
was
a
victim
of
physical
abuse
by
an
unnamed
hospital
staff
member

Youtube
video
The
Hackeys
reported
that
their
son
Noah
suffered
a
mysterious
fracture
to
his
tibia
in
September

The
family
was
informed
by
CPS
that
the
injury
was
due
to
physical
abuse
by
a
hospital
staffer
though
at
the
time
the
identity
of
the
perpetrator
was
unknown

The
Hackeys
received
a
letter
from
Henrico
s
Department
of
Social
Services
with
findings
from
a
Child
Protective
Services
investigation
stating
Following
a
thorough
Child
Protective
Services
investigation
this
agency
has
determined
the
disposition
of
this
report
to
be
FOUNDED
LEVEL
ONE
for
physical
abuse
of
Noah
by
an
employee
in
the
Henrico
Doctors
Hospital
NICU

A
founded
disposition
means
a
review
of
the
facts
shows
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
child
abuse
neglect
occurred

A
level
one
finding
indicates
the
injuries
conditions
real
or
threatened
did
or
were
likely
to
have
resulted
in
serious
harm
to
the
child

This
finding
set
the
stage
for
a
more
comprehensive
review
of
cases
and
heightened
scrutiny
of
NICU
operations

IFrame
HCA
which
owns
Henrico
Doctor
s
Hospital
said
in
a
statement
We
are
both
shocked
and
saddened
by
this
development
in
the
investigation
and
are
focused
on
continuing
to
care
for
our
patients
and
providing
support
to
our
colleagues
who
have
been
deeply
and
personally
impacted
by
this
investigation

We
are
grateful
to
those
colleagues
who
have
dedicated
their
professional
lives
to
the
care
and
safety
of
our
patients
as
well
as
to
law
enforcement
and
the
other
agencies
who
have
worked
aggressively
and
tirelessly
with
us
on
this
investigation

Enhanced
Safety
Measures
Implemented
In
response
to
these
incidents
Henrico
Doctors
Hospital
took
swift
action
to
enhance
security
and
protect
its
patients

The
hospital
installed
new
surveillance
systems
and
implemented
stricter
safety
protocols

These
measures
included
comprehensive
training
for
staff
on
identifying
and
reporting
signs
of
abuse

Perhaps
most
notably
the
hospital
introduced
an
observer
system
where
each
healthcare
provider
is
now
accompanied
by
another
clinician
when
entering
a
baby
s
room

This
buddy
system
approach
aims
to
provide
an
additional
layer
of
oversight
and
accountability
in
patient
care

Nurses
React
to
the
Ongoing
Investigation
The
arrest
of
Strotman
may
not
be
the
end
of
this
case

Police
are
actively
reviewing
additional
cases
and
have
reopened
previously
closed
cases
related
to
these
incidents

This
suggests
that
the
full
scope
of
the
alleged
misconduct
may
not
yet
be
known

As
the
investigation
continues
there
is
a
possibility
that
additional
charges
could
be
brought
against
Strotman

The

have
expressed
shock
and
profound
sadness
over
these
developments

Their
focus
now
is
on
continuing
to

while
supporting
colleagues
who
have
been
affected
by
the
investigation
and
its
fallout

In
an
effort
to
ensure
a
thorough
investigation
the
public
has
been
urged
to
come
forward
with
any
information
related
to
these

This
call
for

involvement
underscores
the
seriousness
with
which

their
commitment

Milestones
from
to
months
It
might
surprise
you
how
quickly
your
baby
is
picking
up
new
skills

Infant
development
milestones
for
a
to
-month-old
include
sitting
standing
and
laughing

By
Mayo
Clinic
Staff
As
your
baby
becomes
more
mobile
and
curious
infant
development
takes
off

It
might
seem
that
your
baby
learns
something
new
every
day

Understand
these
next
milestones
and
what
you
can
do
to
promote
your
baby
s
growth

What
to
expect
Babies
grow
and
develop
at
their
own
pace

From
ages
to
months
your
baby
is
likely
to
experience
Advancing
motor
skills

By
this
age
most
babies
can
roll
over
in
both
directions
even
in
their
sleep

Most
babies
also
can
sit
on
their
own
while
others
need
a
little
support

You
might
notice
your
baby
beginning
to
scoot
rock
back
and
forth
or
even
crawl
across
the
room

Some
babies
this
age
can
pull
themselves
to
a
standing
position

Soon
your
baby
might
take
some
steps
while
holding
the
edge
of
a
couch
or
low
table

Improved
hand-eye
coordination

Most
babies
this
age
move
objects
from
one
hand
to
another
or
directly
to
their
mouths

Pulling
objects
closer
with
a
raking
motion
of
the
hands
will
give
way
to
more-refined
movements
such
as
picking
up
objects
with
just
the
thumb
and
forefinger

These
skills
will
help
your
baby
handle
a
spoon
and
soft
finger
foods

Evolving
communication

Babies
communicate
through
sounds
gestures
and
facial
expressions

You
ll
probably
hear
plenty
of
laughing
and
squealing

Some
babies
might
repeat
the
sounds
they
hear
or
give
it
their
best
shot

Your
baby
s
babbling
is
likely
to
include
chains
of
sounds
such
as
ba-ba-ba

You
might
even
pick
out
an
occasional
mama
or
dada

Stranger
anxiety

Many
babies
this
age
become
wary
of
strangers

Your
baby
might
resist
staying
with
anyone
other
than
you

If
your
baby
fusses
when
you
leave
the
excitement
of
a
new
toy
or
event
might
provide
a
distraction

Your
baby
will
likely
stop
crying
as
soon
as
you
re
out
of
sight

Teething

Babies
start
getting
teeth
during
this
time

But
teeth
may
come
in
later
too

You
might
notice
your
baby
drooling
more
than
usual
and
chewing
on
just
about
anything

Try
gently
rubbing
the
gums
with
one
of
your
fingers
or
offer
a
rubber
teething
ring

Avoid
teething
gels
or
other
medications

When
your
baby
s
first
teeth
appear
use
a
soft-bristled
toothbrush
to
clean
them

Until
your
child
learns
to
spit
at
about
age
use
a
smear
of
fluoride
toothpaste
no
bigger
than
the
size
of
a
grain
of
rice

Promoting
your
baby
s
development
For
babies
of
any
age
learning
and
play
are
inseparable

To
support
your
budding
adventurer
Create
an
exploration-safe
environment

Keep
only
safe
objects
within
your
baby
s
reach

Move
anything
that
could
be
poisonous
pose
a
choking
hazard
or
break
into
small
pieces

Cover
electrical
outlets
and
use
stairway
gates

Gates
between
rooms
can
help
keep
your
fast-moving
baby
in
safe
areas
too

Place
cords
from
blinds
or
shades
out
of
reach

Install
child
locks
on
doors
and
cabinets

If
you
have
furniture
with
sharp
edges
remove
it
from
rooms
where
your
baby
plays

The
same
goes
for
lightweight
objects
your
baby
can
use
to
pull
up
into
a
standing
position
such
as
plant
stands
small
tables
potted
trees
and
floor
lamps

Anchor
bookcases
televisions
and
their
stands
to
the
wall

Keep
chatting

You
ve
likely
been
talking
to
your
baby
all
along

Keep
it
up

Describe
what
you
re
doing
and
give
your
baby
time
to
reply

After
you
say
something
wait
for
your
baby
to
repeat
the
sounds

Sing
simple
songs

Ask
your
baby
questions
that
involve
more
than
a
yes
or
no
response

You
might
not
be
able
to
pick
words
from
your
baby
s
babble
but
you
can
encourage
a
back-and-forth
conversation

Teach
cause
and
effect

Push
the
button
on
a
musical
toy
and
dance
to
the
tune

Open
the
door
on
a
toy
barn
and
listen
to
the
cow
say
moo

Help
your
baby
do
the
same

Self-confidence
will
grow
as
your
baby
realizes
how
to
make
things
happen

Take
time
to
play

By
now
you
and
your
baby
might
be
very
good
at
games
you
ve
been
playing
such
as
peekaboo
patty-cake
and
itsy-bitsy
spider

Get
creative

Arrange
cushions
and
pillows
on
a
carpeted
floor
and
encourage
your
baby
to
creep
or
crawl
over
them

Stack
blocks
and
invite
your
baby
to
knock
them
down

At
bath
time
provide
small
containers
and
plastic
utensils
for
pouring
and
mixing

Pull
out
the
books

Set
aside
time
for
reading
every
day
even
if
it
s
only
a
few
minutes

Reading
aloud
is
one
of
the
simplest
ways
to
boost
your
baby
s
language
development

Make
it
more
interesting
with
facial
expressions
sound
effects
and
voices
for
various
characters

Store
books
within
easy
reach
so
that
your
baby
can
explore
them
whenever
the
mood
strikes

When
something
s
not
right
Your
baby
might
reach
some
developmental
milestones
ahead
of
schedule
and
lag
behind
a
bit
on
others

This
is
common

It
s
a
good
idea
however
to
be
aware
of
the
signs
or
symptoms
of
a
problem

Consult
your
baby
s
health
care
provider
if
you
re
concerned
about
your
baby
s
development
or
if
by
the
end
of
month
nine
your
baby
Does
not
make
eye
contact
or
respond
to
their
name

Has
not
learned
gestures
such
as
waving

Does
not
look
for
objects
that
you
hide
during
games

Does
not
crawl
or
sit
on
their
own

Uses
one
side
of
the
body
more
than
the
other

Trust
your
instincts

The
earlier
a
problem
is
found
the
earlier
it
can
be
treated

Then
you
can
set
your
sights
on
the
milestones
that
lie
ahead

Overview
RSV
can
be
dangerous
for
infants
and
some
young
children

Each
year
in
the
United

an
estimated
children
younger
than

are
hospitalized
due
to
RSV

Children
at
greatest
risk
for
severe
illness
from
RSV
include
Infants
and

the
age
the

not
be
severe
when

less
Cough
which
may
progress
to
wheezing
or
difficulty
breathing
RSV
in
very
young
Infants
Infants
who
get
RSV
almost
always
show
symptoms

This
is
different
from
adults
who
can
sometimes
get

infants
less
than
months
old
the
symptoms
of
RSV
may
include
Irritability
Decreased
activity
Eating
or
drinking
less
Apnea
pauses
in
breathing
for
more
than
seconds
Many

will
not
have
a
fever
with
RSV
infection

Severe

Most
of
the
time
RSV
causes
a
mild
cold-like
illness
but
it
can
also
cause
severe
illness
such
as
Bronchiolitis
inflammation
of
the
small
airways
in
the
lung
Pneumonia
infection
of
the
lungs
Two
to
three
out
of
every
infants
under
months
are
hospitalized
with
RSV
every
year

Those
who
are
hospitalized
may
require
oxygen
IV
fluids
if
they
aren
t
eating
and
drinking
and
mechanical
ventilation
a
machine
to
help
with
breathing
Most
improve
with
this
type
of
supportive
care
and
are
discharged
in
a
few
days

When
to
seek
emergency
care
Seek
medical
attention
if
your
child
is
having
difficulty
breathing
not
drinking
enough
fluids
or
experiencing
worsening
symptoms

Plot
synopsis

Sarah
Ouseph
Neena
Gupta
is
suffering
from
hallucinations
probably
related
to
her
career
as
an
obstetric
head
nurse
in
the
past

She
s
living
with
her
son
Bibin
Ouseph
Sanju
Sivram
in
Mundakkayam
after
retirement

Sarah
is
very
controlling
and
Bibin
is
apparently
okay
with
that

Bibin
works
as
a
lab
technician
in
a
nearby
lab
and
caters
to
all
the
needs
of
Sarah

On
a
fateful
day
Sarah
reveals
some
disturbing
secrets
related
to
her
past
to
Bibin
and
struggling
to
deal
with
how
Sarah
changed
his
destiny
Bibin
attacks
Sarah
and
flees
with
Sarah
s
diaries

Sarah
is
admitted
to
a
hospital
and
requests
of
the
doctor
to
arrange
a
meeting
with
a
local
CI
and
a
legal
advisor

She
hands
over
letters
to
them
one
for
the
police
and
one
for
the
magistrate
Joy
Mathew
Soon
after
Sarah
dies
while
the
police
decide
not
to
pursue
the
crimes
done
by
Sarah
as
there
is
no
way
to
deal
with
the
social
situation
if
her
secrets
are
out
in
public

However
the
truth
overwhelms
Bibin
and
he
chooses
to
go
and
learn
more
about
his
original
parents

As
soon
as
he
learns
the
child
that
was
swapped
with
him
was
treating
her
parents
badly
he
decides
to
make
her
go
away
and
deviously
concocts
a
plan
that
leads
to
her
death

Having
all
the
information
of
the
babies
his
foster
mother
swapped
he
goes
through
one
by
one
with
the
help
of
like-minded
others
who
share
his
ideology
with
the
intention
of
removing
individuals
from
the
face
of
the
planet
especially
those
who
did
not
live
up
to
the
opportunities
they
got

However
he
also
starts
sending
a
series
of
cryptic
letters
to
a
friend
of
his
which
catches
the
attention
of
the
Kerala
police
and
they
are
on
his
case

watch
sports
for

the
appearance
of

could
be
a
determining
factor
in
who
they

This
is
no
different
in

While

be
on

Sexiest
Possibly
Fake
Pratfall
of
the
Year
Jennifer
Lawrence
Jennifer
Lawrence
didn
t
just
win
best
actress
this
year
she
upped
the
awesome
and
ate
shit
on
her
way
to
the
podium

If
it
had
happened
to
anyone
else
the
Internet
would
ve
cast
down
its
eyes
to
maintain
her
dignity
in
the
face
of
gravest
embarrassment

But
Lawrence
who
had
won
the
infatuation
of
men
and
the
be-my-BFF-ness
of
women
was
in
fact
accused
of
doing
it
on
purpose

It
was
an
extension
they
claimed
of
her
brassy
anti-class
the
young
woman
who
had
visited
old-lady
strip
clubs
in
ATL
on
off-shooting
nights
peed
herself
when
laughing
too
hard
still
got
beat
up
by
her
brothers
and
apparently
couldn
t
move
in
a
gown

We
re
here
to
tell
you
She
didn
t
stage
it
not
thinking
shit
out
is
what
makes
her
different
from
every
other
actress
in
movies

Sometimes
crazy
happens

Like
Jack
Nicholson
hitting
on
you
backstage
at
the
Oscars
the
creepy
cherry
on
top
of
the
whole
evening

George
Stephanopoulos
on
hand
interviewing
her
was
horrified
Jennifer
Lawrence
was
all
unfazed
bliss

I

This
isn
t
the
first
aside
Frank
Underwood
makes
in
the
pilot
of
House
of
Cards
but
it
was
the
first
one
that
made
us
laugh
out
loud
and
then
also
think
This
marriage
is
KILLER

Here
s
what
you
can
learn
from
the
marital
compromises
of
Frank
and
Claire

Anything
is
possible
without
secrets

Even
sanctioned
affairs

Trade
favors

You
get
your
cub
reporter
I
get
my
foreign
photographer

Don
t
force
each
other
to
quit

Just
share
cigarettes

When
proposing
marriage
say
Claire
if
all
you
want
is
happiness
say
no

I
promise
you
ll
never
be
bored

Speaking
of
Which

A
Million
Little
Mileys
Between
June
and
September
Miley
metamorphized
from
a
sweet-drawling
tween
star
into
a
twerking
terrorizing

It
happened

fast

About
Until

Hundreds

of
thousands

of
millions
of
words
were
wasted
this
year
on
Miley-Cyrus-twerk
think
pieces

Is
she
profiting
off
of
black
culture

What
are
Beyoncé
s
thoughts

Miley
s
dad
s
thoughts

And
most
important
what
is
the
medical
explanation
for
Miley
s
lack
of
ass

This
was
the
year
white-people
fondness
for
twerking
overshadowed
their
fondness
for
Homeland

But
all
that
talk
without
harkening
back
to
the
original
Twerk
Team

You
know
the
Internet-famous
Atlanta-based
twerk
duo

Well
possibly
you
don
t
But
not
paying
homage
is
still
criminal

We
started
in

It
was
a
hobby
that
turned
into
a
business
for
us
after
we
dropped
our
first
YouTube
video
to
that

she

Even
though
their

has
become
a
nationwide
craze
they
re
good

We
give
Miley
props

We
re
not

generous

The
Best
Minutes
of
the
Year
No
actress
took
a
bigger
bite
out
of
less
screen
time
than
Emma
Watson

In
she
appeared
briefly
in
one
movie
and
for
a
half
hour
in
another
but
was
the
indisputable
scene
stealer
in
each

Here
s

efficiency

The
best
minutes
of
This

the
End
Chooses
to
brave
the
apocalypse
over

night
at

Back

Give

everything

Chooses

The

Is
there
anyone
better
at
beating
up
the
boys
than
Sarah
Silverman

At
the
James
Franco
roast

On
Jonah
Hill
Jonah
actually
gained
fifty
pounds
for
his
role
in
the
new
Martin
Scorsese
film
because
the
producers
wanted
the
character
to
be
a
Jonah
Hill
type
But
seriously
you
ve
had
such
a
body
transformation
in
the
past
couple
of
years

You
have
come
a
long
way
from
just
being
Sonny
and
Cher
s
daughter

On
Aziz
Ansari
I
have
been
a
huge
supporter
of
Aziz
for
years
and
for
only
the
price
of
a
cup
of
coffee

And
on
Franco
I
don
t
think
James
is
necessarily
gay
or
straight

I
think
he
just
literally
can
t
open
his
eyes
enough
to
see
who
he
s
fucking

Water
is
poured
on
the
head
of
an
infant
held
over
the
baptismal
font
of
a
Roman
Catholic
church

Infant
baptism
or
paedobaptism
is
the
practice
of
baptizing
infants
or
young
children

Infant
baptism
is
also
called
christening
by
some
faith
traditions

Most
Christians
belong
to
denominations
that
practice
infant
baptism

Branches
of
Christianity
that
practice
infant
baptism
include
Catholicism
Eastern
Orthodoxy
and
Oriental
Orthodoxy

Among
Protestants
several
denominations
practice
infant
baptism
including
Anglicans
Lutherans
Presbyterians
Congregationalists
Methodists
Nazarenes
Moravians
and
United
Protestants

Christians
who
do
not
practice
infant
baptism
are
called
credobaptists

Ceremony
edit
The
exact
details
of
the
baptismal
ceremony
vary
among
Christian
denominations

Many
follow
a
prepared
ceremony
called
a
rite
or
liturgy

In
a
typical
ceremony
parents
or
godparents
bring
their
child
to
their
congregation
s
priest
or
minister

The
rite
used
would
be
the
same
as
that
denomination
s
rite
for
adults
i
e
by
pouring
holy
water
affusion
or
by
sprinkling
water
aspersion
Eastern
Orthodox
and
Eastern
Catholic
traditions
practice
total
immersion
and
baptize
babies
in
a
font
and
this
practice
is
also
the
first
method
listed
in
the
baptismal
ritual
of
the
Roman
Catholics
although
pouring
is
the
standard
practice
within
the
Latin
branch
of
Catholicism

Catholic
and
Orthodox
churches
that
do
this
do
not
sprinkle

At
the
moment
of
baptism
the
minister
utters
the
words
I
baptize
you
or
The
servant
of
God
name
is
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
Father
and
of
the
Son
and
of
the
Holy
Spirit
see
Matthew
better

Although
it
is
not
required
many
parents
and
godparents
choose
to
dress
the
baby
in
a
white
gown
called
a
christening
gown
for
the
baptism
ceremony

Christening
gowns
often
become
treasured
keepsakes
that
are
used
by
many
other
children
in
the
family
and
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation

Traditionally
this
gown
is
white
or
slightly
off
white
and
made
with
much
lace
trim
and
intricate
detail

In
the
past
a
gown
was
used
for
both
boys
and
girls
in
the
present
day
it
has
become
more
common
to
dress
children
in
a
baptismal
outfit

Also
normally
made
of
white
fabric
the
outfit
consists
of
a
romper
with
a
vest
or
other
accessories

These
clothes
are
often
kept
as
a
memento
after
the
ceremony

Ritual
purification
Christianity
Scholars
disagree
on
the
date
when
infant
baptism
was
first
practiced

Some
believe
that
-century
Christians
did
not
practice
it
noting
the
lack
of
any
explicit
evidence
of
infant
baptism

Others
noting
the
lack
of
any
explicit
evidence
of
exclusion
of
infant
baptism
believe
that
they
did
understanding
biblical
references
to
individuals
and
her
household
being
baptized
as
including
young
children

The
earliest
extrabiblical
directions
for
baptism
which
occur
in
the
Didache
c
are
taken
to
be
about
baptism
of
adults
since
they
require
fasting
by
the
person
to
be
baptized

However
inscriptions
dating
back
to
the
century
which
refer
to
young
children
as
children
of
God
may
indicate
that
Christians
customarily
baptized
infants
too

The
earliest
reference
to
infant
baptism
was
by
Irenaeus
c
in
his
work
Against
Heresies

Due
to
its
reference
to
Eleutherus
as
the
current
bishop
of
Rome
the
work
is
usually
dated
c

Irenaeus
speaks
of
children
being
born
again
to
God

Three
passages
by
Origen
c
mention
infant
baptism
as
traditional
and
customary

Also
Augustine
of
Hippo
referred
the
baptism
of
children
as
an
apostolic
tradition

While
Tertullian
writing
c
advises
the
postponement
of
baptism
of
little
children
and
the
unmarried
he
mentions
that
it
was
customary
to
baptize
infants
with
sponsors
speaking
on
their
behalf

The
Apostolic
Tradition
sometimes
attributed
to
Hippolytus
of
Rome
died
describes
how
to
perform
the
ceremony
of
baptism
it
states
that
children
were
baptized
first
and
if
any
of
them
could
not
answer
for
themselves
their
parents
or
someone
else
from
their
family
was
to
answer
for
them

From
at
least
the
century
onward
Christians
baptized
infants
as
standard
practice
although
some
preferred
to
postpone
baptism
until
late
in
life
so
as
to
ensure
forgiveness
for
all
their
preceding
sins

Theology

Agreements
among
infant
baptizers
edit
Based
on
their
understanding
of
New
Testament
passages
such
as
Colossians
Christians
who
baptize
infants
believe
that
infant
baptism
is
the
New
Testament
counterpart
to
the
Old
Testament
circumcision

In
the
Old
Testament
all
male
converts
to
Judaism
male
infants
born
to
Jewish
parents
and
male
servants
were
circumcised
as
ceremony
of
initiation
into
the
Jewish
community

Christians
who
baptize
infants
believe
that
baptism
has
replaced
Old
Testament
circumcision
and
is
the
religious
ceremony
of
initiation
into
the
Christian
community

During
the
medieval
and
Reformation
eras
infant
baptism
was
seen
as
a
way
to
incorporate
newborn
babies
into
the
secular
community
as
well
as
inducting
them
into
the
Christian
faith

Due
to
high
rates
of
infant
mortality
it
is
important
to
note
that
canon
law
denied
unbaptized
infants
a
Christian
burial
in
sacred
ground

Church

Different
Christian
denominations
who
practice
infant
baptism
attach
different
meanings
to
the
sacrament
and
explain
its
efficacy
in
different
ways

Catholic
Church
edit
The
Catholic
Church
considers
baptism
even
for
an
infant
so
important
that
parents
are
obliged
to
see
that
their
infants
are
baptized
within
the
first
few
weeks
and
if
the
infant
is
in
danger
of
death
it
is
to
be
baptized
without
any
delay

It
declares
The
practice
of
infant
Baptism
is
an
immemorial
tradition
of
the
Church

There
is
explicit
testimony
to
this
practice
from
the
second
century
on
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
from
the
beginning
of
the
apostolic
preaching
when
whole
households
received
baptism
infants
may
also
have
been
baptized
It
notes
that
when
the
first
direct
evidence
of
infant
Baptism
appears
in
the
second
century
it
is
never
presented
as
an
innovation
that
-century
Irenaeus
treated
baptism
of
infants
as
a
matter
of
course
and
that
at
a
Synod
of
African
Bishops
St

Cyprian
stated
that
God
s
mercy
and
grace
should
not
be
refused
to
anyone
born
and
the
Synod
recalling
that
all
human
beings
are
equal
whatever
be
their
size
or
age
declared
it
lawful
to
baptize
children
by
the
second
or
third
day
after
their
birth
In
the
and
centuries
many
infants
were
baptized
on
the
day
of
their
birth
as
in
the
cases
of
Francoise-Athenais
Marquise
de
Montespan
Jeanne
Du
Barry
and
Marie
Anne
de
Cupis
de
Camargo

Infant
baptism
is
seen
as
showing
very
clearly
that
salvation
is
an
unmerited
favor
from
God
not
the
fruit
of
human
effort

Born
with
a
fallen
human
nature
and
tainted
by
original
sin
children
also
have
need
of
the
new
birth
in
Baptism
to
be
freed
from
the
power
of
darkness
and
brought
into
the
realm
of
the
freedom
of
the
children
of
God
to
which
all
men
are
called
The
Church
and
the
parents
would
deny
a
child
the
priceless
grace
of
becoming
a
child
of
God
were
they
not
to
confer
Baptism
shortly
after
birth
The
church
has
no
dogmatic
official
teaching
regarding
the
fate
of
infants
who
die
without
baptism
and
theologians
of
the
church
hold
various
views
in
particular
many
have
asserted
that
they
go
to
Limbo
The
Church
entrusts
these
infants
to
the
mercy
of
God

The
Congregation
for
the
Doctrine
of
the
Faith
issued
on
October
an
instruction
on
infant
baptism
whose
purpose
was
to
recall
the
principal
points
of
doctrine
in
this
field
which
justify
the
Church
s
constant
practice
down
the
centuries
and
demonstrate
its
permanent
value
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
raised
today
The
document
then
indicated
some
general
guidelines
for
pastoral
action

The
document
recalled
that
infant
baptism
has
long
been
considered
of
apostolic
origin
and
that
the
first
direct
evidence
of
its
practice
dating
from
the
century
does
not
present
it
as
an
innovation

It
then
responded
to
objections
that
baptism
should
follow
faith
that
the
person
baptized
should
consciously
receive
the
grace
of
the
sacrament
that
the
person
should
freely
accept
baptism
that
infant
baptism
is
unsuitable
in
a
society
marked
by
instability
of
values
and
conflicts
of
ideas
and
that
the
practice
is
inimical
to
a
missionary
outlook
on
the
part
of
the
church

The
instruction
then
gave
guidelines
for
pastoral
practice
based
on
two
principles

The
major
principle
is
that
baptism
as
the
sign
and
means
of
God
s
love
that
precedes
any
action
on
our
part
and
that
frees
from
original
sin
and
communicates
divine
life
must
not
be
delayed

The
subordinate
principle
is
that
assurances
must
be
given
that
the
gift
thus
granted
can
grow
by
authentic
education
in
the
faith
and
Christian
life

If
these
assurances
are
not
really
serious
there
can
be
grounds
for
delaying
baptism

If
they
are
certainly
absent
the
sacrament
should
even
be
refused

Accordingly
the
rules
for
involvement
on
the
part
of
practicing
Christian
parents
must
be
supplemented
with
other
considerations
in
the
case
of
families
with
little
faith
or
non-Christian
families
If
these
request
that
a
child
of
theirs
be
baptized
there
must
be
assurances
that
the
child
will
be
given
the
benefit
of
the
Christian
upbringing
required
by
the
sacrament

Examples
of
such
assurances
are
the
choice
of
godparents
who
will
take
sincere
care
of
the
child
or
the
support
of
the
community
If
there
is
satisfactory
assurance
i
e
any
pledge
giving
a
well-founded
hope
for
the
Christian
upbringing
of
the
children
then
the
priest
cannot
refuse
to
celebrate
the
sacrament
without
delay
as
in
the
case
of
children
of
Christian
families
If
there
is
insufficient
assurance
it
will
be
prudent
to
delay
baptism
while
keeping
contact
with
the
parents
in
the
hope
of
securing
the
required
conditions
for
celebrating
the
sacrament

As
a
last
resort
enrollment
of
the
child
in
a
course
of
catechetical
instruction
on
reaching
school
age
can
be
offered
in
lieu
of
immediate
celebration
of
baptism

The
possibility
of
delaying
infant
baptism
in
the
case
of
non
practicing
or
non
believing
parents
raises
a
number
of
questions

How
can
we
discern
that
there
are
guarantees
of
an
authentic
Christian
education

Can
a
priest
propose
an
alternative
celebration
in
the
case
where
baptism
is
to
be
delayed

In
some
German
speaking
countries
bishops
have
opened
the
door
to
a
two
step
baptism
i
e
two
celebrations
separated
by
a
time
of
evangelization
of
the
parents

In
this
case
the
rite
of
baptism
itself
is
to
be
performed
in
the
second
celebration
when
parents
are
supposed
to
have
enough
maturity
to
raise
the
child
in
the
Catholic
faith

The
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
states
Since
Baptism
signifies
liberation
from
sin
and
from
its
instigator
the
devil
one
or
more
exorcisms
are
pronounced
over
the
candidate
In
the
Roman
Rite
the
wording
of
the
prayer
of
exorcism
is
Almighty
and
ever-living
God
you
sent
your
only
Son
into
the
world
to
cast
out
the
power
of
Satan
spirit
of
evil
to
rescue
man
from
the
kingdom
of
darkness
and
bring
him
into
the
splendour
of
your
kingdom
of
light

We
pray
for
this
child
set
him
her
free
from
original
sin
make
him
her
a
temple
of
your
glory
and
send
your
Holy
Spirit
to
dwell
with
him
her
Through
Christ
our
Lord

and

in
Greek
Orthodox
Church
The
Eastern
Orthodox
Church
Oriental
Orthodoxy
and
the
Assyrian
Church
of
the
East
also
insist
on
the
need
to
have
infants
baptized
as
soon
as
is
practicable
after
birth

Similar
to
the
Catholic
Church
they
teach
that
baptism
is
not
merely
a
symbol
but
actually
conveys
grace

Baptism
is
a
sacrament
because
it
is
an
instrument
instituted
by
Jesus
Christ
to
impart
grace
to
its
recipients

Infants
are
traditionally
baptized
on
the
eighth
day
recalling
the
biblical
injunction
to
circumcise
on
the
eighth
day

However
this
is
not
mandatory

In
many
of
these
churches
the
Sacred
Mystery
of
Chrismation
Confirmation
is
administered
by
the
priest
immediately
after
baptism

Holy
Communion
in
the
form
of
consecrated
wine
and
bread
is
also
given
to
infants
after
they
are
baptized

Lutheran
Churches
edit

German
reformer
Philipp
Melanchthon
baptizing
an
infant
Lutherans
practice
infant
baptism
because
they
believe
that
God
mandates
it
through
the
instruction
of
Jesus
Christ
Go
and
make
disciples
of
all
nations
baptizing
them
in
the
name
of
the
Father
and
of
the
Son
and
of
the
Holy
Spirit
in
which
Jesus
does
not
set
any
age
limit
The
command
is
general

It
includes
infants
women
men
and
teenagers
even
though
none
of
these
groups
is
specifically
named

Each
of
these
groups
is
included
in
all
nations

They
also
cite
other
biblical
passages
such
as
Mark
-
Mark
John
-
and
Acts
-
in
support
of
their
position

For
example
in
the
Acts
of
the
Apostles
Peter
s
teachings
on
Pentecost
included
children
in
the
promise
of
baptism
Repent
and
be
baptized
every
one
of
you
in
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
for
the
forgiveness
of
your
sins

And
you
will
receive
the
gift
of
the
Holy
Spirit

The
promise
is
for
you
and
your
children
For
them
baptism
is
a
means
of
grace
through
which
God
creates
and
strengthens
saving
faith
as
the
washing
of
regeneration
in
which
people
are
reborn
John
baptismal
regeneration
Since
the
creation
of
faith
is
exclusively
God
s
work
it
does
not
depend
on
the
actions
of
the
one
baptized
whether
infant
or
adult

Even
though
baptized
infants
cannot
articulate
that
faith
Lutherans
believe
that
it
is
present
all
the
same

Because
it
is
faith
alone
that
receives
these
divine
gifts
Lutherans
confess
that
baptism
works
forgiveness
of
sins
delivers
from
death
and
the
devil
and
gives
eternal
salvation
to
all
who
believe
this
as
the
words
and
promises
of
God
declare
In
the
special
section
on
infant
baptism
in
his
Large
Catechism
Luther
argues
that
infant
baptism
is
God-pleasing
because
persons
so
baptized
were
reborn
and
sanctified
by
the
Holy
Spirit

Lutherans
WELS
believe
that
babies
are
conceived
and
born
sinful
and
therefore
need
to
be
born
again
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven

Through
Baptism
the
Holy
Spirit
works
rebirth
creates
faith
in
them
and
saves
them

Although
some
deny
the
possibility
of
infant
faith
the
Bible
clearly
teaches
that
babies
can
believe

A
baptistry
in
a
Methodist
church
In
the
Methodist
Churches
baptism
is
a
sacrament
of
initiation
into
the
visible
church

Wesleyan
covenant
theology
further
teaches
that
baptism
is
a
sign
and
a
seal
of
the
covenant
of
grace
Of
this
great
new-covenant
blessing
baptism
was
therefore
eminently
the
sign
and
it
represented
the
pouring
out
of
the
Spirit
the
descending
of
the
Spirit
the
falling
of
the
Spirit
upon
men
by
the
mode
in
which
it
was
administered

As
a
seal
also
or

sign
baptism
answers
to
circumcision

Infant
baptism
in
Methodism
is
celebrated
as
an
acceptance
of
the
prevenient
grace
of
God
and
as
a
confession
on
the
part
of
the
church
of
its
responsibility
for
children
in
general
and
for
every
child
in
particular

Methodists
teach
that
people
receive
justifying
grace
which
is
integral
to
salvation
after
they
repent
and
personally
accept
Jesus
as
Savior

Many
Methodist
denominations
such
as
the
Free
Methodist
Church
and
Allegheny
Wesleyan
Methodist
Connection
practice
infant
baptism
for
families
who
desire
it
for
their
children
but
provide
a
rite
for
child
dedication
for
those
who
have
a
preference
for
credobaptism
only
after
their
child
has
made
a
personal
acceptance
of
Jesus
as
his
her
savior

Presbyterian
Congregational
and
Reformed
Churches
edit
Presbyterian
Congregational
and
Reformed
Christians
believe
that
baptism
whether
of
infants
or
adults
is
a
sign
and
seal
of
the
covenant
of
grace
and
that
baptism
admits
the
party
baptized
into
the
visible
church

Being
a
member
of
the
visible
church
does
not
guarantee
salvation
though
it
does
provide
the
child
with
many
benefits
including
that
of
one
s
particular
congregation
consenting
to
assist
in
the
raising
of
that
child
in
the

he
should
go

he
will
not

Elect
infants
those
predestined
for

who
die
in
infancy
are
by
faith
considered
regenerate
on
the
basis
of
God
s
covenant
promises
in
the
covenant
of
grace

Presbyterian
Congregational
and
many
Reformed
Christians
see
infant
baptism
as
the
New
Testament
form
of
circumcision
in
the
Jewish
covenant

Circumcision
did
not
create
faith
in
the
-day-old
Jewish
boy

It
merely
marked
him
as
a
member
of
God
s
covenant
people
Israel

Likewise
baptism
does
not
create
faith
it
is
a
sign
of
membership
in
the
visible
covenant
community

Presbyterian
Congregational
and
Reformed
Christians
consider
children
of
professing
Christians
to
be
members
of
the
visible
church
the
covenant
community
They
also
consider
them
to
be
full
members
of
the
local
congregation
where
their
parents
are
members
and
members
of
the
universal
church
the
set
of
all
true
believers
who
make
up
the
invisible
church
unless
and
until
they
prove
otherwise

Baptism
is
the
mark
of
membership
in
the
covenant
of
grace
and
in
the
universal
church
although
regeneration
is
not
inseparably
connected
with
baptism

Contrasts
between
infant
and
adult
baptism
edit
Infant
baptism
can
be
contrasted
with
what
is
called
believer
s
baptism
or
credobaptism
from
the
Latin
word
credo
meaning
I
believe
which
is
the
religious
practice
of
baptizing
only
individuals
who
personally
confess
faith
in
Jesus
therefore
excluding
underage
children

Pedobaptism
and
credobaptism
are
positions
which
bubble
up
from
theological
views
at
a
more
fundamental
level
of
one
s
theological
system

If
baptism
is
a
sign
that
a
person
is
a
member
of
God
s
covenant
community
and
if
the
children
of
believers
are
members
of
that
community
it
follows
that
the
children
of
believers
should
receive
the
sign
that
they
are
members
of
God
s
covenant
community
by
being
baptized
as
an
infant
is
entitled
to
a
passport
that
indicates
the
child
as
a
member
of
a
particular
country

Believers
and
the
children
of
believers
become
members
of
God
s
covenant
community
or
church
through
baptism

It
is
believed
by
some
Christians
that
in
the
heart
of
a
baptized
child
faith
as
a
gift
or
grace
from
God
as
distinct
from
an
act
by
the
person
is
made
present

It
is
believed
by
some
Christians
that
baptism
is
not
merely
a
symbol
and
that
it
has
a
real
effect
conveying
divine
grace

Arguments
for
infant
baptism
edit
Christians
who
practice
infant
baptism
do
not
completely
agree
on
the
reasons
for
doing
so
and
offer
different
reasons
in
support
of
the
practice

Among
the
arguments
made
in
support
of
the
practice
are
Analogy
with
circumcision
Some
Christians
posit
an
analogy
of
baptism
to
circumcision
pointing
to
children
since
the
historic
Israelite
application
of
circumcision
was
to
infants
not
to
adult
converts
of
which
there
were
few

Covenant
theology
identifies
baptism
less
as
a
statement
of
faith
than
as
an
assumption
of
identity
that
is
to
say
that
infant
baptism
is
a
sign
of
covenantal
inclusion

Assuming
that
what
God
instituted
in
the
Old
Testament
continues
unless
the
New
Testament
specifically
abrogates
it
including
infants
in
the
giving
of
the
sign
of
the
covenant
must
continue
in
the
New
Covenant

It
is
especially
so
if
the
practice
is
an
important
one

Jesus
affirmation
According
to
Luke
-
when
parents
brought
their
babies
to
Jesus
the
disciples
tried
to
prevent
them
from
coming

Jesus
becomes
indignant
and
says
Let
the
little
children
come
to
me
and
do
not
hinder
them
for
the
kingdom
of
God
belongs
to
such
as
these

This
seems
to
confirm
that
infants
can
have
a
personal
relationship
with
Jesus
just
as
parents
can
have
a
personal
relationship
with
their
babies

More
importantly
Jesus
confirms
that
babies
of
believers
belong
to
the
kingdom
of
God

In
other
words
babies
of
believers
are
counted
as
believers
not
unbelievers

Therefore
Jesus
specifically
instructs
not
to
hinder
them

Peter
s
speech
According
to
the
Book
of
Acts
Peter
replied
Repent
and
be
baptized
every
one
of
you
in
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
for
the
forgiveness
of
your
sins

And
you
will
receive
the
gift
of
the
Holy
Spirit

The
promise
is
for
you
and
your
children
and
for
all
who
are
far
off
for
all
whom
the
Lord
our
God
will
call

Acts
NIV
UK
emphasis
added
Some
churches
within
The
United
Methodist
Church
argue
that
the
phrase
every
one
of
you
recalls
the
use
of
the
same
phrase
in
Deuteronomy
where
there
is
explicit
mention
of
the
little
ones
present
and
it
takes
the
phrase
and
your
children
to
mean
that
Peter
included
children
in
the
covenant
community

Early
Christian
practice
Several
early
Church
Fathers
seem
to
have
taught
that
infant
baptism
is
proper
Origen
states
that
the
practice
of
baptizing
infants
is
of
apostolic
origin

Arguments
against
infant
baptism
edit
Infants
cannot
repent
or
believe
Baptism
in
Scripture
always
has
the
prerequisite
of
repentance
and
faith
which
are
impossible
for
an
infant

No
scriptural
instances
There
are
no
explicit
instances
of
infant
baptism
in
the
scripture
Denominations
and
religious
groups
opposed
to
infant
baptism
edit
Trinitarian
Christian
denominations
that
oppose
infant
baptism
include
the
International
Christian
Church
all
Baptist
and
Anabaptist
traditions
and
denominations
Pentecostals
Assemblies
of
God
and
more

Several
nontrinitarian
religious
groups
also
oppose
infant
baptism
including
Oneness
Pentecostals
Christadelphians
Jehovah
s
Witnesses
United
Church
of
God
and
the
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latter-day
Saints

B
R
White
describes
the
motivations
behind
persecution
of
the
Anabaptists
during
the
Reformation
as
follows
Other
Christians
saw
the
baptism
of
each
new-born
baby
into
the
secular
parish
community
and
close
links
between
church
and
state
as
the
divinely-ordained
means
of
holding
society
together

Hence
many
other
Christians
saw
the
Anabaptists
as
subversive
of
all
order

Consequently
from
the
earliest
days
they
were
sharply
persecuted
and
leaders
were
soon
executed

The
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latter-day
Saints
LDS
Church
completely
rejects
infant
baptism

Little
children
are
considered
both
born
without
sin
and
incapable
of
committing
sin

They
have
no
need
of
baptism
until
age
eight
when
they
can
begin
to
learn
to
discern
right
from
wrong
and
are
thus
accountable
to
God
for
their
own
actions

However
the
LDS
Church
performs
a
non-saving
ordinance
to
name
and
bless
children
customarily
performed
on
infants

Confirmation
edit
For
Roman
Catholic
Methodist
Christians
and
Weslian
Confirmation
strengthens
the
original
meaning
of
the
word
confirm
the
grace
of
Baptism
by
conferring
an
increase
and
deepening
of
that
grace

In
Eastern
Christianity
including
the
Eastern
Catholic
Churches
the
sacrament
of
Confirmation
is
conferred
immediately
after
baptism
and
there
is
no
renewal
of
baptismal
promises

In
the
Latin
Church
and
its
Latin
liturgical
rites
of
the
Catholic
Church
the
sacrament
is
to
be
conferred
at
about
the
age
of
discretion
generally
taken
to
be
about
unless
the
Episcopal
Conference
has
decided
on
a
different
age
or
there
is
danger
of
death
or
in
the
judgment
of
the
minister
a
grave
reason
suggests
otherwise
canon
of
the
Code
of
Canon
Law
The
renewal
of
baptismal
promises
by
those
receiving
the
sacrament
in
the
Western
Catholic
Church
is
incidental
to
the
rite
and
not
essentially
different
from
the
solemn
renewal
of
their
baptismal
promises
that
is
asked
of
all
members
of
this
church
each
year
at
the
Easter
Vigil
service

Only
in
French-speaking
countries
has
there
been
a
development
of
ceremonies
quite
distinct
from
the
sacrament
of
Confirmation
for
young
Catholics
to
profess
their
faith
publicly
in
line
with
their
age

Within
the
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latter-day
Saints
confirmation
or
the
laying
on
of
hands
is
an
essential
part
of
the
baptismal
ordinance
and
to
receive
baptism
without
confirmation
is
to
leave
the
ordinance
incomplete

Confirmation
is
the
conferring
of
the
gift
of
the
Holy
Ghost
as
a
constant
companion

To
confirm
means
to
make
more
sure
and
the
ordinance
of
confirmation
stands
as
a
witness
of
the
individual
becoming
a
member
of
the
LDS
Church
and
not
just
an
acceptance
of
Jesus

Opposition
to
infant
baptism
edit
According
to
Catholic
legal
professor
and
former
Irish
president
Mary
McAleese
as
outlined
in
her
doctoral
thesis
infant
baptism
amounts
to
enforced
membership
of
the
Catholic
Church
which
violates
fundamental
rights
of
children

These
infant
conscripts
are
held
to
lifelong
obligations
of
obedience
without
their
understanding
or
consent

Parents
can
guide
and
direct
their
children
but
they
can
t
impose
and
what
the
church
has
failed
to
do
is
to
recognize
that
there
has
to
be
a
point
at
which
our
young
people
as
adults
who
have
been
baptized
into
the
church
and
raised
in
the
faith
have
the
chance
to
say
I
validate
this
or
I
repudiate
this
You
and
I
know
we
live
now
in
times
where
we
have
the
right
to
freedom
of
conscience
freedom
of
belief
freedom
of
opinion
freedom
of
religion
and
freedom
to
change
religion

The
Catholic
Church
yet
has
to
fully
embrace
that
thinking

Controversies
edit
Baptisms
have
sometimes
accidentally
led
to
injuries
or
deaths
such
as
drowning
deaths
to
babies

In
Romania
this
has
served
as
an
opportunity
to
revise
practices

Yazidi
baptism
edit
IMG
Baptism
of
a
Yazidi
child
in
Lalish
In
Yazidism
children
are
baptized
at
birth
and
circumcision
is
not
required
but
is
practiced
by
some
due
to
regional
customs

The
Yazidi
baptism
is
called
Mor
kirin
literally
to
seal
Traditionally
Yazidi
children
are
baptized
at
birth
with
water
from
the
Kaniya
Sipî
White
Spring
at
Lalish

It
involves
pouring
holy
water
from
the
spring
on
the
child

head
three
times

The

When
they
baptize
babies
pastors
should
make
sure
that
their
prayers
include
clear
requests
that
God
will
bring
the
children
to
a
personal
faith
that
owns
what
the
parents
are
promising
at
a
time
when
the
children
who
belong
from
day
one
cannot
act
for
themselves

And
when
they
dedicate
children
pastors
should
make
sure
that
their
prayers
include
clear
gratitude
to
God
for
the
fact
that
he
is
already
at
work
in
the
life
of
that
child
who
already
belongs
in
the
Christian
community

Here
s
what
must
be
stressed
whether
at
the
time
of
baptism
in
the
adult
baptism
tradition
or
at
the
time
of
confirmation
when
the
vows
made
earlier
by
the
parents
are
personally
owned
in
the
infant
baptism
tradition
it
is
faith
in
Jesus
dependent
trust
not
mere
cognitive
affirmation
that
is
crucial

Paul
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
without
faith
and
obedience

old

As
a
parent
you
give
your
children
a
good
start
in
life
you
nurture
protect
and
guide
them

Learn
about
developmental
milestones
including
emotional
and
social
development
for
babies
from
birth
to
one
year
of
age

There
are
many
things
you
can
do
to
help
your
baby
stay
safe
and
healthy

A
smiling
baby

Developmental
milestones
Skills
such
as
taking
a
first
step
smiling
for
the
first
time
and
waving
bye-bye
are
called
developmental
milestones

Most
children
achieve
these
milestones
by
a
certain
age

Children
reach
milestones
in
how
they
play
learn
speak
behave
and
move
such
as
crawling
walking
or
jumping
In
the
first
year
babies
learn
to
focus
their
vision
reach
out
explore
and
learn
about
the
things
around
them

Cognitive
or
brain
development
means
the
learning
process
of
memory
language
thinking
and
reasoning

Learning
language
is
more
than
making
sounds
babbling
or
saying
ma-ma
and
da-da

Listening
understanding
and
knowing
the
names
of
people
and
things
are
all
a
part
of
language
development

During
this
stage
babies
form
bonds
of
love
and
trust
with
their
parents
and
others
shaping
their
social
and
emotional
development

The
way
parents
cuddle
hold
and
play
with
their
baby
will
set
the
basis
for
future
interactions
with
them
and
others

Positive
parenting
tips
Following
are
some
things
you
as
a
parent
can
do
to
help
your
baby
during
this
time
Talk
to
your
baby

They
will
find
your
voice
calming

Answer
when
your
baby
makes
sounds
by
repeating
the
sounds
and
adding
words

This
will
help
them
learn
to
use
language

Read
to
your
baby

This
will
help
them
develop
and
understand
language
and
sounds

Sing
to
your
baby
and
play
music

This
will
help
your
baby
develop
a
love
for
music
and
will
help
their
brain
development

Praise
your
baby
and
give
them
lots
of
loving
attention

Spend
time
cuddling
and
holding
your
baby

This
will
help
them
feel
cared
for
and
secure

Play
with
your
baby
when
they
re
alert
and
relaxed

Watch
your
baby
closely
for
signs
of
being
tired
or
fussy
so
that
they
can
take
a
break
from
playing

Distract
your
baby
with
toys
and
move
them
to
safe
areas
when
they
start
moving
and
touching
things
that
they
shouldn
t
touch

Take
care
of
yourself
physically
mentally
and
emotionally

Parenting
can
be
hard
work

It
is
easier
to
enjoy
your
new
baby
and
be
a
positive
loving
parent
when
you
are
feeling
good
yourself

Child
safety
first
When
a
baby
becomes
part
of
your
family
it
is
time
to
make
sure
that
your
home
is
a
safe
place

Look
around
your
home
for
things
that
could
be
dangerous
to
your
baby

Take
the
necessary
steps
to
make
sure
that
you
are
mentally
and
emotionally
ready
for
your
new
baby

Here
are
a
few
tips
to
keep
your
baby
safe
Do
not
shake
your
baby
ever

Babies
have
very
weak
neck
muscles
that
can
not
yet
support
their
heads

If
you
shake
your
baby
you
can
damage
their
brain
or
even
cause
their
death

Make
sure
you
always
put
your
baby
to
sleep
on
their
back
to
prevent
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
known
as
SIDS
Protect
your
baby
and
family
from
secondhand
smoke

Do
not
allow
anyone
to
smoke
in
your
home

Prevent
your
baby
from
choking
by
cutting
their
food
into
small
bites

Also
don
t
let
them
play
with
small
toys
and
other
things
that
might
be
easy
for
them
to
swallow

Don
t
allow
your
baby
to
play
with
anything
that
might
cover
their
face

Never
carry
hot
liquids
or
foods
near
your
baby
or
while
holding
your
baby

Vaccines
shots
are
important
to
protect
your
child
s
health
from
serious
diseases

Talk
with
your
child
s
doctor
to
make
sure
your
child
is
up-to-date
on
their
vaccinations

Breastfeeding
is
the
natural
way
to
feed
your
baby

Breast
milk
meets
all
your
baby
s
needs
for
about
the
first
months
of
life

Between
and
months
of
age
your
baby
will
learn
about
new
tastes
and
textures
with
healthy
solid
food

However
breast
milk
should
still
remain
an
important
source
of
nutrition

Feed
your
baby
slowly
and
patiently
encourage
them
to
try
new
tastes
but
without
force
and
watch
closely
to
see
if
they
re
still
hungry

Keep
your
baby
active

They
might
not
be
able
to
run
and
play
like
the
big
kids
just
yet
but
there
s
lots
they
can
do
to
keep
their
little
arms
and
legs
moving
throughout
the
day

Getting
down
on
the
floor
to
move
helps
your
baby
become
strong
learn
and
explore

Try
not
to
keep
your
baby
in
swings
strollers
bouncer
seats
and
exercise
saucers
for
too
long

Limit
screen
time

For
children
under
months
of
age
the
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
AAP
recommends
that
babies
do
not
use
any
screen
media
other
than
video
chatting

Make
sure
your
child
gets
the
recommended
amount
of
sleep
each
night

Concussion
In
Babies
Image

A
concussion
in
babies
is
a
head
injury
that
may
affect
their
brain
functioning
which
may
lead
to
various
physical
and
cognitive
symptoms

Before
a
baby
arrives
most
parents
take
all
the
necessary
precautions
to
ensure
their
little
one
s
safety
such
as
baby-proofing
their
homes

However
despite
all
their
efforts
their
babies
may
suffer
minor
injuries

Though
minor
injuries
cause
short-term
pains
and
often
resolve
over
time
concussions
could
affect
their
growth
and
developmental
outcomes

Altogether
one
must
follow
important
safety
measures
such
as
keeping
the
floor
dry
and
devoid
of
things
that
could
make
a
baby
fall

This
could
help
control
falls
and
head
injuries
in
babies
and
prevent
the
consequences
of
an
infant
concussion

In
this
post
we
discuss
the
causes
complications
and
other
important

of
concussions
in
babies

to
avoid
them

What
Is
A
Concussion

According
to
the
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
a
concussion
is
a
head
injury
caused
by
a
sudden
jolt
or
blow
that
could
disrupt
normal
brain
functioning
This
condition
is
mostly
benign
with
the
impact
on
brain
function
typically
being
temporary

But
in
some
cases
a
concussion
or
infant
head
injury
might
disrupt
normal
brain
activity
and
make
the
baby
unconscious

The
Harvard
Medical
School
grades
concussion
on
three
scales
of
severity
described
below
Grade
The
least
severe
form
of
concussion
when
the
individual
s
brain
functions
return
to
normalcy
after
minutes

Grade
When
the
brain
malfunctions
and
the
person
is
confused
for
more
than
minutes

Grade
When
the
impact
is
so
severe
that
the
person
becomes
unconscious

As
a
concussion
may
be
severe
you
need
to
be
alert
and
look
out
for
the
signs
of
concussion
in
a
baby

A
National
Health
Interview
Survey
NHIS
report
evaluated
the
percentage
of
children
who
had
ever
had
symptoms
of
a
concussion
or
brain
injury
in
different
age
groups

As
the
graph
below
depicts
of
children
showed
signs
and
symptoms
of
brain
injury
of
which
were
children
under
five

Also
the
incidence
of
these
injuries
appears
to
increase
with
age

Signs
And
Symptoms
Of
Concussion
In
Babies
Babies
may
seem
confused
or
are
unable
to
understand
instructions
Image
Shutterstock
A
concussion
is
a
type
of
closed
head
injury
in
infants
in
which
the
brain
might
get
affected
but
without
any
prominent
marks
on
the
skull
Thus
the
signs
of
traumatic
brain
injury
in
infants
are
subtle
and
parents
may
find
it
difficult
to
understand
if
the
baby
has
had
a
concussion

Symptoms
may
not
show
immediately
after
the
injury
However
you
could
look
out
for
these
Loss
of
consciousness
The
baby
could
become
unconscious
or
slip
into
semi-consciousness
due
to
the
injury
to
the
neurons
affecting
normal
brain
function

Dizziness
or
body
balance
issues
Babies
might
lose
balance
while
walking
or
crawling
indicating
poor
coordination
in
body
movements

Dazed
confused
and
slurred
speech
The
baby
is
unable
to
understand
instructions
and
seems
unresponsive

Older
infants
who
can
talk
will
have
trouble
forming
sentences
and
may
not
speak
clearly

Abrupt
loss
of
interest
The
baby
does
not
enjoy
the
toys
games
and
activities
and
tends
to
stay
calm
and
silent
most
of
the
time

Crying
excessively
A
concussion
could
be
like
a
dull
pain
making
the
baby
cry
irritable
and
cranky

Vomiting
and
nausea
The
baby
is
unable
to
digest
anything
and
throws
up
whatever
they
are
fed

Toddlers
and
older
babies
may
complain
about
feeling
sick
in
the
stomach

Sudden
change
in
daily
routine
There
is
a
sudden
change
in
eating
sleeping
and
diaper
soiling
patterns

Bleeding
or
fluid
oozing
from
nose
or
ears
Blood
from
nose
or
ears
indicates
damaged
blood
vessels

If
the
baby
does
not
have
a
cold
but
has
a
clear
fluid
dripping
from
the
nose
then
it
could
be
the
cerebrospinal
fluid
iA
clear
watery
fluid
that
flows
in
the
empty
spaces
around
the
brain
and
spinal
cord

which
is
leaking
through
the
skull
and
out
through
the
nose

Seizures
Seizures
in
babies
include
fits
convulsions
iRapid
and
involuntary
muscle
contractions
that
lead
to
rapid
and
rhythmic
shaking
of
the
body
especially
limbs

and
episodes
of
loud
crying
with
violent
body
movement


Stiffness
or
droopiness
The
baby
s
body
seems
stiff
or
droopy

The
limbs
could
appear
to
be
fixed
or
moving
around
involuntarily

Some
of
the
above
signs
and
symptoms
are
seen
immediately
due
to
the
concussion

The
others
that
either
persist
or
arise
later
are
referred
to
as
post-concussion
syndrome
iA
condition
where
a
person
experiences
dizziness
headaches
or
issues
with
concentration
and
memory
after
a
trauma
to
the
brain

You
must
also
keep
an
eye
out
for
other
probable
signs
such
as
a
wound
or
bump
on
the
head

An
infant
may
also
touch
a
part
of
the
head
repeatedly
especially
while
crying
indicating
pain
in
that
part

Prompt
pediatric
consultation
is
advised
for
a
head
or
brain
injury
in
newborns
to
avoid
complications

What
Causes
A
Concussion
In
Babies

Babies
may
fall
while
hopping
or
running
and
hurt
themselves
Image
Shutterstock
A
variety
of
reasons
can
lead
to
concussions
or
acquired
brain
injury
in
children
as
they
have
rudimentary
reflexes
and
cannot
protect
themselves

Having
a
fall
Babies
falling
from
the
bed
having
tripped
on
an
object
or
falling
while
hopping
or
running
could
hurt
themselves
and
cry
loudly

If
the
child
is
older
they
would
call
out
a
parent

In
such
a
case
check
for
bruises
or
lacerations
as
they
may
suggest
a
pediatric
concussion

Babies
can
also
fall
from
other
high
platforms
like
a
small
chair
or
sofa
and
hurt
themselves

A
study
by
UNICEF
found
that
falling
from
ground
level
accounted
for
of
fatal
falls
The
risk
can
increase
substantially
when
an
older
infant
tries
to
run
hop
or
jump
over
an
obstacle

Julia
a
mom
of
four
talks
about
an
incident
when
she
thought
that
her
son
might
have
had
a
concussion

She
recalls
I
know
we
had
a
guardian
angel
with
us
at
that
moment
because
somehow
Truman
fell
out
of
the
rocker
chair
and
remained
on
the
landing
instead
of
rolling
all
the
way
down
the
rest
of
the
stairs
and
since
the
whole
carrier
fell
out
of
my
hand
he
didn
t
free
fall
from
my
waist
but
instead
tipped
out
of
the
entire
seat
onto
his
little
forehead

It
was
following
this
moment
that
Julia
thought
that
her
son
might
have
a
fall-induced
concussion
i
When
an
object
falls
on
the
head
A
baby
could
playfully
yank
the
wire
of
a
table
lamp
or
an
older
infant
could
shake
a
big
object
making
it
fall
on
their
head

Baby
hits
the
head
to
an
object
Babies
can
hit
their
head
to
an
object
while
crawling
or
walking

For
example
older
infants
who
crawl
at
a
faster
pace
may
not
notice
objects
in
front
of
them
or
walk
head-first
into
something

Vehicle
accident
Babies
are
at
a
greater
risk
of
head
injuries
in
car
crashes
because
their
heads
are
larger
in
proportion
to
their
bodies
They
can
also
sustain
a
concussion
due
to
a
fall
from
a
two-wheeler
or
when
riding
a
tricycle
or
bicycle

As
you
may
have
noticed
simple
everyday
activities
can
be
a
cause
for
concussion
in
babies

The
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics
recommends
as
a
safety
measure
that
you
take
your
baby
to
a
doctor
if
there
is
any
injury
to
the
head
and
to
check
for
post-concussion
syndrome
in
babies

How
Is
Concussion
In
Babies
Diagnosed

Doctors
check
for
signs
of
brain
trauma
such
as
a
bruise
or
swelling
on
the
head
Image
iStock
Only
a
medical
practitioner
can
make
a
conclusive
diagnosis
and
tell
if
the
baby
has
a
concussion
or
an
intracranial
hemorrhage

Here
is
how
the
condition
diagnosed
Check
for
the
physical
signs
The
doctor
checks
for
external
signs
of
brain
trauma
such
as
a
bruise
wound
or
swelling
on
the
head

Further
checks
would
be
made
to
find
any
swelling
in
the
fontanelles
the
soft
membranous
tissue
that
connects
the
skull
bones
of
an
infant

Injured
blood
vessels
rupture
internally
and
bleed
which
is
seen
on
the
skin
as
a
blue-black
patch
bruises
In
severe
concussions
the
baby
may
develop
blue
or
black
skin
discolorations
around
the
eyes
or
behind
the
ears

An
unbalanced
dilation
of
the
pupils
may
occur
where
one
eye
is
permanently
dilated
while
the
other
is
normal

Both
eyes
may
stay
dilated
with
wide-open
pupils
that
do
not
respond
to
light

The
doctor
would
check
for
such
dilations
and
abnormalities

Basic
medical
tests
A
concussion
can
cause
a
malfunction
in
motor
skills
and
a
doctor
tests
these
skills
to
determine
the
damage

In
the
case
of
suspected
malfunctioning
the
doctor
could
conduct
basic
tests
to
discern
if
the
baby
s
vision
and
hearing
are
affected

For
this
the
doctor
would
check
the
movement
of
the
baby
s
head
in
response
to
a
sound
or
baby
s
ability
to
spot
a
moving
object
in
peripheral
vision

In
the
case
of
older
infants
the
doctor
would
ask
the
infant
to
touch
the
nose
throw
a
ball
walk
in
a
straight
line
or
something
similar

Imaging
tests
If
the
test
results
are
inconclusive
or
the
symptoms
of
concussion
are
severe
then
the
doctor
would
conduct
imaging
tests
to
assess
the
skull

An
x-ray
may
be
the
first
choice
since
it
is
quick
to
identify
an
infant
skull
fracture

Scans
such
as
CT
and
MRI
can
be
conducted
in
more
severe
cases
as
they
provide
a
three-dimensional
image
of
the
baby
s
skull

Once
the
doctor
confirms
the
concussion
the
treatment
begins
immediately

most
important
treatment
since
it
is
non-invasive
baby-safe
and
also
ideal
for
a
non-open
wound
condition
such
as
a
concussion
The
doctor
would
advise
you
to
keep
the
baby
away
from
vigorous
physical
activities
involving
cognitive
skills
as
the
brain
needs
rest

Topical
ointment
If
the
baby
has
a
bruise
or
small
wound
at
the
point
of
impact
then
the
doctor
could
prescribe
a
topical
ointment
primarily
to
prevent
infection
and
alleviate
the
pain

Quick
tip
Your
baby
should
play
quietly
for
at
least
hours
after
the
injury
and
screen
time
should
be
limited
Some
home
remedies
for
pain
such
as
an
ice
pack
might
help
the
infant
feel
better
but
do
not
force
it
if
the
baby
is
not
comfortable
with
the
cold
sensation

What
Are
The
Long-Term
Effects
Of
Concussion
In
Infants

Concussions
heal
over
time
and
do
not
usually
cause
any
serious
health
problems
or
brain
damage
in
infants

However
it
is
wise
to
get
a
concussion
checked
by
a
medical
professional
to
know
the
extent
of
the
damage

Severe
head
injuries
could
lead
to
Loss
of
developmental
milestones
If
the
injury
alters
the
brain
motor
skills
the
baby
might
lose
out
on
some
achieved
milestones

An
infant
may
reach
a
milestone
only
to
forget
it
in
a
few
days

You
may
notice
a
complete
regression
in
skills
and
abilities

Permanent
problems
while
feeding
or
sleeping
The
baby
is
unable
to
sleep
or
eat
properly
and
has
a
changed
regime

In
severe
cases
of
trauma
the
infant
may
develop
insomnia
which
is
an
inability
to
fall
asleep
Vertigo
Vertigo
is
the
dizzy
feeling
that
occurs
in
bouts
or
is
triggered
by
a
random
stimulus

The
condition
can
persist
forever
returning
in
intervals
of
days
or
weeks

Vertigo
caused
by
a
concussion
is
referred
to
as
posttraumatic
vertigo
iA
condition
where
a
person
experiences
dizziness
and
other
symptoms
of
vertigo
after
a
severe
or
blunt
injury
to
the
head
or
neck

Pause
in
head
circumference
growth
Some
cases
of
severe
concussion
could
pause
the
growth
in
the
baby
s
head
circumference
for
a
few
weeks
The
head
growth
resumes
weeks
later
but
head
growth
could
lag
in
comparison
to
the
rest
of
the
body

Poor
concentration
and
cognitive
disability
Older
infants
may
have
trouble
picking
up
new
words

They
might
also
lose
concentration
even
during
activities
they
like

If
the
problem
persists
then
it
may
cause
severe
cognitive
impairment
iA
condition
where
a
person
experiences
a
decline
in
mental
abilities
like
remembering
learning
concentrating
and
decision-making

and
intellectual
disabilities

Pediatricians
may
suggest
regular
check-ups
to
track
the
baby
s
recovery
and
ensure
they
are
reaching
developmental
milestones

Parents
should
watch
for
any
ongoing
symptoms
and
keep
open
communication
with
healthcare
providers
about
their
child
s
progress

Most
concussions
do
not
cause
any
long-term
effects

However
you
can
minimize
the
risk
of
both
short
and
long-term
problems
by
preventing
concussions

How
To
Prevent
Concussions
In
Babies

You
can
mitigate
the
risk
of
concussions
or
mild
traumatic
brain
injury
in
infants
by
keeping
your
baby
safe
at
home

Here
are
a
few
precautions
you
can
take
Baby-proof
your
house
Tie
the
wires
high
above
and
remove
elevated
objects
that
can
cause
injury
when
they
fall
over
the
head

Cover
all
the
sharp
edges
of
furniture
and
remove
items
such
as
a
carpet
or
doormat
that
the
baby
could
trip
on

Never
leave
an
infant
unattended
Babies
tend
to
be
fidgety
and
love
to
hold
and
move
things
but
it
must
be
under
adult
supervision

Older
infants
should
also
play
under
adult
supervision
especially
while
playing
with
things
such
as
a
football
or
swing
and
slides

Parents
can
greatly
lower
the
risk
of
head
injuries
by
closely
supervising
their
children
and
creating
safe
play
areas

to
hold
and
move

Get
a
crib
for
the
baby
Babies
must
sleep
in
cribs
that
are
specifically
designed
for
their
age

Do
not
let
your
baby
sleep
alone
on
regular
beds
as
babies
tend
to
roll
off
the
edges

Point
to
consider
Install
changing
tables
with
-inch
guardrails
to
avoid
accidental
falls
Get
baby
car
seat
Buy
an
infant
safety
harness
for
your
baby
when
traveling
in
a
car
even
for
short
distances

Choose
safety
harnesses
certified
by
reputable
agencies
or
organizations

Choose
a
five-point
harness
over
a
three-point
one

A
five-point
harness
straps
the
infant
to
the
seat
at
five
points
and
has
two
shoulder
points
two
hip
points
and
one
between
the
legs

The
three-point
harness
leaves
out
the
two
hip
points

Babies
should
be
latched
facing
the
rear
of
the
car
as
it
prevents
a
sharp
shock
to
the
neck
and
head
in
case
of
a
forward
collision

Quick
tip
You
may
use
Baby
head
protection
accessories
that
are
available
to
protect
them
from
bumps
and
bruises

How
do
I
test
for
a
concussion
at
home

You
should
get
your
child
examined
by
a
doctor
if
you
have
the
slightest
doubt
because
babies
cannot
verbalize
how
they
feel

You
should
visit
the
doctor
if
you
find
them
uncomfortable
or
less
active
than
usual

How
to
know
if
my
baby
is
okay
after
they
fall
off
the
couch

Remain
calm
and
observe
the
baby
s
behavior

If

normal
reaction

In
such
cases
gently
pick
the
baby
and
console
them
Take
care
of
minor
injuries
and
try
to
lighten
their
mood

However
if
they
vomit
show
signs
of
extreme
sleepiness
or
there
is
blood
discharge
from
the
ears
or
nose
promptly
contact
a
doctor

Can
my
baby
get
a
concussion
from
falling
backwards

It
is
rare
to
get
a
concussion
by
banging
their
head
against
a
wall
hitting
their
head
on
their
crib
or
falling
backward
from
a
standing
position
However
prompt
pediatric
evaluation
is
necessary
if
your
baby
has
anything
more
than
a
light
bump
in
the
affected
area
or
if
you
notice
other
signs
of
concussion
in
a
baby
such
as
vomiting
dizziness
or
stumbling
Can
my
baby
get
brain
damage
if
they
fall

In
children
less
than
six
years
of
age
a
fall
from
a
great
height
such
as
from
a
wall
or
a
window
in
the
attic
can
cause
significant
brain
damage

In
some
cases
there
may
be
skull
fracture
as
well
Falls
from
lower
heights
still
require
medical
attention
though
they
may
not
cause
brain
damage
A
baby
concussion
is
a
brain
injury
that
can
be
assessed
on
three
severity
scales

While
most
concussions
are
grade
or
if
your
infant
sustains
a
grade
injury
it
may
impact
their
brain
functioning
as
well
as
their
growth
and
development

Blood
from
the
nose
or
ears
excessive
crying
vomiting
dizziness
and
other
symptoms
may
develop

Thus
if
the
baby
has
recently
suffered
a
head
injury
it
is
advisable
to
have
them
inspected
by
a
doctor

Moreover
taking
simple
precautions
such
as
baby-proofing
the
house
using
a
baby
car
seat
and
a
crib
could
effectively
prevent
concussions
in
babies
